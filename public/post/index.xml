      <description>Prefect workflow is about 1% efforct and 99% tweaking</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Holy configuring time. Tweaking whatever, editor, notes app, keyboard, shell, OS, browser extension, information system, and some new concept like second brain, roam-like backlink information system. Wow, there is a lot to play with, so that we can do nothing and config them all the time!</p>
<h1 id="config-editor">CONFIG EDITOR</h1>
<p>Editor with infinite extendibility like Neovim, Emacs is extremely addictive. Both of them come with their own scripting language, so that you can do &ldquo;editor programmimg&rdquo;, make it the way you like, make it to prefectly fit your workflow and strange needs. Especially eamcs, there exist so much packages that can help you &ldquo;live in Emacs&rdquo;. Nevertheless, you can choose not to. Neovim in other hand, has less feature than Emacs, but still very configurable. Time is very easy gone when try some new package or new feature. Sometimes I just want to add some plugins for my neovim, after install it. I decide to spend &ldquo;some time&rdquo; to read the documents, but turn out I have spent whole afternoon finding some special API to change the plugin to the way I want to.</p>
<h1 id="config-terminal">CONFIG TERMINAL</h1>
<p>If you are Mac and linux user, you should have known an app GUI application called &ldquo;Terminal&rdquo;, it is another time-sink. First, we have to choose a terminal. If I use many Temrinal application, I would consider replacement for the system given one. After that, I have to config the font, color scheme so that it is usable. Still not yet finished, You have to had a handy shell, you should choose one from some common shell like fish, zsh, or bash. You have to spend extra time to make the shell usable, it will take longer if you choose zsh and bash, since you will have to know many tecnical terms like &ldquo;zle&rdquo;, &ldquo;precmd_functions&rdquo;, &ldquo;LBUFFER&rdquo;, &ldquo;setopt&rdquo;, &hellip; There are so much required knowledge if you really want to make zsh and bash into &ldquo;your shape&rdquo;. Oh GOD, already spending a week of time? If you want to have mutliple tabs opened, so that convient youself to have many cli application progess at the same time, you should either pick <strong>tmux</strong> or functionility provided from the terminal you pick. If the temrinal you pick is alacritty, then you have no choice, you are forced to use <strong>Tmux</strong>. If you are fine to use mouse to create and navigate tabs with you GUI temrinal, you can do less. If you prefer keyboard-driven, then you have to spend extra time just for creating your own style shortcut key. If you choose to accept the default keybindings. Either of them suck, because you will find the default key bindings conflict with other hot keys of cli tools like emacs or vim, or you will realized that they are not designed for human(Tmux). Yet, if you want to leverge terminal and shell to automate your workflow, you should spend even more time to learn the scripting language sh. Bash, Zsh, and Sh are POXIS compabible shell, you knowledge can be used in other shell. If you are used to Bash but decide to use Fish, you will have to learn the new language(actually new style, basically python-like). AHHHHH, everything should be done, right? you still lacking the interface to interact with your os, they are the tones of command line tools, some of them sed, ls, cd, z, rm, mv, cp. With every tool have their unique set of options( so call flags, althoug the name of flags follow some pattern, I guess you still don&rsquo;t want to remember all of them ). After all, you have your environment prepared, and finally able to start your work? Definitly not, still too many to config!</p>
<h1 id="config-desktop-environment">CONFIG DESKTOP ENVIRONMENT</h1>
<p>Desktop environment is the sand box to contain all your configurable tools, where itself is another tweakable stuff. The crazier one is window manager, like i3, hyperland, dwm. If you don&rsquo;t know what is window manager, you can go to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/">/unixporn</a> have a quick look, those fancy binary split window are managed by window manager. You have to write your own config file or copy from others. However, if you want to &ldquo;make it fit your workflow better&rdquo;, you are better understanding what are in your config file, yet extra time have to spent. I personally prefer Desktop environment like gnome, kde and xfce. I don&rsquo;t have crazy many window popup anytime, most of the time the window are fixed in some places, gnome extension <a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/28/gtile/">gtile</a> already cover most of the use case. But when I start personalizing gnome ( I don&rsquo;t want the top bar appear, I have a small laptop screen ). I still unavoidly need to tweak a little bit. Embarssingly, I find gnome is not portable, when I move to new machine, I have to config gnome again( I will find the solution to prepare for future merging ).</p>
<h1 id="build-information-system">BUILD INFORMATION SYSTEM</h1>
<p>Wow, wow, wow, to build information system is never an easy task. You need a good editor, either have good extension support, or originally built for information processing. Otherwise, you need to spend some time to find the best solution for collecting, grouping, manage and organize information into useful knowledge. It is really hard to find one application can do all of them. All-in-one solution like Notion works very well with chart data, while it don&rsquo;t have a decent editor as powerful as vim or emacs( it don&rsquo;t support vi mode! ). Some general purpose editor like emacs, though it has gui version that can render rich content, but its UI is hard to battle with Other domain specify gui application. In other words, you can make the UI as beauty as them of course, but it require time and quite useless. Eventually, to have a prefect information system, the hardest part is how you can connect all discrete application together to do useful stuff and keep it forward. If you system is not robust enough to fit your future requirement, how should you handle?</p>
<h1 id="consistent-hot-keys">CONSISTENT HOT KEYS</h1>
<p>Consistent hot key style anywhere is difficult, if you are vi-mode fever, I guess You will want to use vim everywhere, because it is the reason you live on the earth. Your blood is flowing in your body with hjkl(is hjkl really the most amazing magic of vim? But not text object and modal editing? Why so many recommend vim because you can use hjkl to replace your arrow key! ). However, seriously, outside text editing, is vi-mode still have the magic? Is it really better than mouse and keyboard shortcut? Nevertheless, it is a personal choice. The only things I can ensure, it is difficult to maintain many vi-mode on many non-vim application with personalized config.</p>
<h1 id="reailty-of-config">Reailty of config</h1>
<p>Configuration most of the time grow up naturally, new feature is used only when you need this, I believe nobody will spend a month merely try to make your workflow and tools to be prefect. You leverge the old feature, find another way that can smooth you workflow, then you learn it, try it, love it. That how config should be. It grows from day to day, my current config do not appear suddenly, I add a few lines each time. So eventually I don&rsquo;t feel that I have spend crazy amount of time for config.</p>
<p>Yet I don&rsquo;t feel that I have spent many time on config, I actually spend lot of time <strong>playing</strong> with those configurable &ldquo;toys&rdquo;. TASTING THE UNKOWN FEATTURE IS FUN, ISN&rsquo;T IT? It is hard to describe the feeling. Imagine you build an axes with LEGO( config ) and try to cut down a tree(real world task) &hellip; and it works &hellip; AMAZING!</p>

      <title>KMonad: The Software version of QMK</title>

      <description>Kmonad is a software that can be run on MacOS, Linux, Windows, reject the need of complible keyboard</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Kmonad repository on Github <a href="https://github.com/kmonad/kmonad">https://github.com/kmonad/kmonad</a></p>
<p>I find the default QWERTY keyboard layout have too much keys that require pinkys to type. Chances is very high that My pinkys will sucks first before I can become a hacker! If you don&rsquo;t like complible keyboard like me for whatever reason. Kmonad is likely to be the ultimate solution, Works on most platform, super protable, install Kmonad, copy keymaps file to new mahcine, finally get Kmonad run, and you have your own keymaps on any machine able to run kmoand. Moreover, Kmonad is one of the fews solution you can change your keyboard layouts on laptop.</p>
<p>Kmonad run on both Xory and Wayland on linux without any extra tweakings.</p>
<p>The only issue is &hellip; I nearly unable to have natural typing experience on vanilla QWERTY keyboard. Merely a few keys change will have huge influence!</p>
<p>Though I have mentioned that Kmonad is crossplatform, I find Kmoand work the best on linux. You will end up ith some issue and require extra tweaks on MacOS and Windows.</p>

<h1 id="what-can-kmonad-do">What can Kmonad do?</h1>
<p>Kmonad is used to create <a href="https://blog.splitkb.com/introduction-to-qmk-features/">layer</a> on top of your keyboard, you can think Kmonad is software implemention of QMK firmware. Similiar tools like Karabiner-Elements may not give the same levels of visualizing layer, Since Karabiner-Elements by default don&rsquo;t provide preview to the layer. While we define each keys&rsquo; action in every layer when you writing Kmonad file. The code already talk you how the layer will be, saving time from memorize and debug.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, if you merely swap a few keys, Kmoand may not be the best choice. Instead choose simpler tools like Karabiner-Elements or xinput will help you.</p>
<h1 id="install-kmonad">Install Kmonad</h1>
<p>You can either install its binary execute file, package(for Arch, Void, GNU Guix, NixOS only), or build it from source(work for most platform).</p>
<p>The official guide: <a href="https://github.com/kmonad/kmonad/blob/master/doc/installation.md">https://github.com/kmonad/kmonad/blob/master/doc/installation.md</a></p>
<h2 id="build-from-source">Build from source</h2>
<p>Let&rsquo;s do this, Since Kmonad is written in Haskell, you will need Haskell project manager: <a href="https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack">stack</a> installed, it should be avalible via package manager on most of linux distro.</p>
<p>Clone kmoand repo and Build:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span class="line"><span class="cl">git clone https://github.com/kmonad/kmonad.git kmonad <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> <span class="nb">cd</span> kmonad <span class="o">&amp;&amp;</span> stack install
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>After build, Kmonad will be in <code>$PATH</code>.</p>
<p>Run <code>stack</code> to check if it is installed</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In Linux we deal with input by performing an ioctl-grab on a specific
device-file. This allows us to hook KMonad on the input of exactly 1 keyboard,
and allows you to run multiple instances of KMonad for different keyboards. We
make an input using:
(device-file &ldquo;/dev/input/by-id/my-keyboard-kbd&rdquo;)</p>
<p>NOTE: Any valid path to a device-file will work, but it is recommended to use
the &lsquo;by-id&rsquo; directory, since these names will not change if you replug the
device.</p>
<p>We deal with output by creating a &lsquo;uinput&rsquo; device. This requires that the
&lsquo;uinput&rsquo; kernel module is loaded. The easiest way to ensure this is by calling
&lsquo;sudo modprobe uinput&rsquo;. We create a uinput device using:
(uinput-sink &ldquo;name&rdquo; &ldquo;optional post-init command&rdquo;)</p>

<p>&ndash; Windows &mdash;-</p>
<p>In Windows we do not get such fine-grained control. We use a low-level
keyboard hook to intercept all non-injected keyboard events. There is
currently an open issue to improve the C-bindings used to capture windows
keyevents, and if you have a better way to approach this issue, help is deeply
appreciated. You specify a windows input using:
(low-level-hook)</p>
<p>Similarly, the output in Windows lacks the fine-grained control. We use the
SendEvent API to emit key events directly to Windows. Since these are
&lsquo;artificial&rsquo; events we won&rsquo;t end up catching them again by the
<code>low-level-hook</code>. It is very likely that KMonad does not play well with other
programs that capture keyboard input like AHK. You specify windows output using:
(send-event-sink)</p>
<p>Specific to Windows, KMonad also handles key auto-repeat.  Therefore your
Windows system settings for key repeat delay and key repeat rate will have no
effect when KMonad is running.  To set the repeat delay and rate from KMonad,
pass the optional arguments pair to <code>send-event-sink</code>:
(send-event-sink [ <!-- raw HTML omitted --> <!-- raw HTML omitted --> ])
where:
<!-- raw HTML omitted --> : how many ms before a key starts repeating
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->  : how many ms between each repeat event
A value of 500 ms delay and 30 ms rate should mimic the default Windows
settings pretty well:
(send-event-sink 500 30)</p>

<h3 id="defsrc">defsrc</h3>
<p>We will deifne the region in the keyboard you want to remap with kmond. The number of keys in defsrc can be less or more than the actual number on your keyboard. If you using a 60% keyboard, it is fine to use the template of 100% keyboard. Merely you will not able to trigger thsoe extra keys. Conversely, you can define 60% region of your 100% keyboard in <code>defsrc</code>. It should work unless you have defined worong keycode. The remaining keys will work as normal if you have set <code>fallthrough</code> true. If you got confused, let see some real example!</p>

<h2 id="start-building-your-own-keyboard-layer">Start building your own keyboard layer</h2>
<p>There is some useful implemention that is useful to add to your keyboard, they are:</p>
<ol>
<li>layer, or in other terms: modifier key, when you hold down some keys, different layer will be active.</li>
<li>leader-key, or some will call it dead key, unlike modifier keys require holding manys keys at a time, leader-key usually use key sequence, type one by one.</li>
<li>tap-mod, give double purpose to single keys, tap it and hold it will trigger two different event</li>
<li>tap-dance, give single different purpose depends on amount of time pressed.</li>
<li>magic keys, usually refer to single key act like 4 modifier hold together(shift+meta+ctrl+alt) when holding</li>

<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-lisp" data-lang="lisp"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">defsrc</span>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The example below will base on this little keyboard.</p>
<h3 id="model-of-kmonad">Model of Kmonad</h3>
<p>Kmonad model layer as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(abstract_data_type)">stack</a>, it will always try to match input event to the top most layer. Still remember the first layer is the default layer, because it is the only layer that addedd to stack when kmonad startup. Noted that incorrect layer push and pop can break your keyboard. It is better to have two keyboard when you config Kmonad, so that you are still able to repair after accidently broke the keyboard.</p>
<h3 id="how-to-write-the-first-layer">How to write the first layer</h3>
<p>Here is an example function, you don&rsquo;t need to know what it is now.</p>

<p>Again, if don&rsquo;t use any alias:</p>

<h3 id="difference-between-tap-and-holding">Difference between tap and holding</h3>
<p>Tap idealy is press and release instantly without delay. In KMonad, which accept if key is released within some threshold value will be triggered as <strong>Tap</strong>. Otherwise, it is holding.</p>
<h3 id="kmonad-functions">KMonad functions</h3>
<p>KMonad will run the function when it is being active. How? when you press the keys, the function will be active if it has been defined in the <code>deflayer</code> block. Moreover, function call be called by other function. For example:</p>

deleted soon, because the more general <code>around-next</code> now exists (see below)

<h3 id="how-to-choose-the-fucntion">How to choose the fucntion</h3>
<p>There is six <code>tap-xxx</code> function that is similar, don&rsquo;t know which one should you pick? Actucally, the difference between them may are not that obvious when you typing. For exampe, the pairs <a href="#tap-next-release">tap-next-release</a> and <a href="#tap-next-press">tap-next-press</a>. I have only occur the difference when I type to fast. Sometime when I type too fast, I will accidently release the key in wrong order so that the <strong>hold</strong> event is not triggered. However, I do agree some is more powerful. Like <a href="#tap-hold-next-release">tap-hold-next-release</a> and <a href="#tap-hold-next">tap-hold-next</a> are way more comfortable. Because most of the time, when one use <code>tap-mod</code> dual function key, you won&rsquo;t want it to fallback to <strong>tap</strong> after holding for some becuase can&rsquo;t decide which key you use. For exmaple</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-lisp" data-lang="lisp"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">tap-next-release</span> <span class="nv">spc</span> <span class="nv">lsft</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="c1">;; tap as spacebar hold as shift</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>You hold the spacebar, want to insert <code>I</code>, but find that actually you should insert <code>i</code>, but since you using <code>tap-next-release</code>, when you relase spacebar, a space is inserted, you have to press backspace. However if you use <code>tap-hold-next-release</code>, this issue will not even happen.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-lisp" data-lang="lisp"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="p">(</span><span class="nv">tap-hold-next-release</span> <span class="mi">250</span> <span class="nv">spc</span> <span class="nv">lsft</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="c1">;; tap as spacebar hold as shift, after hold 250ms become shift</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Same situation, but this time when you release spacebar, it will insert left shift instead, actually nothing inserted. But I should not stop other using the same pattern as me, as one may accidently find the function fix their need perfectly. You can try different function, and decide which one to use. Make a change is just so easy, change the config file, run kmonad, that is. ( a lot easier that recomplie QMK firmware, though KMonad is less feature and powerful as QMK)</p>
<p>Although <code>tap-hold-next-release</code> and <code>tap-hold-next</code> is &ldquo;better&rdquo; than <code>tap-next-press</code> as they will not trigger <strong>tap</strong> event after holding some time, but if I type too fast, I foudn sometimes space is eaten. So I personaly prefer <code>tap-next-press</code> more than any other function.</p>

<p>If you use vim, you may have some mappings like <code>nmap &lt;leader&gt;we &lt;Cmd&gt;W | e!&lt;Cr&gt;</code>. Leader key is keyboard shortcut that is triggered by input keys sequence instead of holding many buttons at the same time. Use <code>&lt;leader&gt;we</code> as an example, we should first choose a key to be leader-key.

      <title>Efficient Vim: try not to overwrite vim default keybindings.</title>

      <description>Try to stand with Vim default key bindings!</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>We know Vim is known as its extentability, why would I recommend you stop making your own configuration? Because it comes with cost.</p>
<h1 id="the-issue">The issue</h1>
<p>You find <code>cw</code> is difficult to type, you find that <code>cl</code> is overlapping with <code>s</code>, you add some remap to your <code>vimrc</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-vim" data-lang="vim"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nx">onoremap</span> <span class="nx">l</span> <span class="nx">w</span><span class="err">
</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="err"></span><span class="nx">onoremap</span> <span class="nx">L</span> <span class="nx">W</span><span class="err">
</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="err"></span><span class="nx">onoremap</span> <span class="nx">h</span> <span class="nx">iw</span><span class="err">
</span></span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="err"></span><span class="nx">onoremap</span> <span class="nx">H</span> <span class="nx">iW</span><span class="err">
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>Indeed, this is how I used to use vim. ( <a href="https://sokinpui.github.io/Blog/post/vim8-useful-keymap/#text-object">link to post</a> ). The keybindings help me, but just so little improvement. Just like other vimers, I tends to use vim style in other application like zsh, Emacs, obsidian and tmux etc. When I sit down and going to work hard, I find the keybindings on them are just wrong, I forget to sync my config on Vim to other application, I have to find solution for each application, luckly, those application is say to be easy to config with their vi-mode. While I can&rsquo;t make sure current situation can apply to future, I can&rsquo;t promise I stil using same set of tools or using the same vim config. The more application I use, the more time I have to spend on finding solution in other to make the application prefectly fix my using case.</p>
<p>I am afraid If I having too much personalization, I would loss the vim compability from any vim emulation one day. One reason keep me using vim is that  there is vim-emulation everywhere, Once I have learn the keybindings, I can keep the same workflow no matter the tools. Therefore, I stop overwriting vim default keybindings. Remapping I use currently are mostly related to plugins, and is trigger by leader key.</p>
<h1 id="outside-vim-the-keyboard-layout-the-cose-of-too-much-personalization">Outside Vim, the keyboard layout, the cose of too much personalization</h1>
<p>The keyboard layout I current I use are my own personalized version, it is build on QWERTY, but I have some change with modifiers, I have made <code>space</code> as sapce-shift(tap as space, held as shift), shift when held, I have made <code>left shift</code> as esc-ctrl, make some changes wiht special symbols, turn <code>caps lock</code> become layer raiser, <code>{</code>, <code>}</code> <code>[</code> and <code>]</code> are <code>caps lock</code> + <code>kjiu</code>. Since those key are highly related to vim motion, my editing and typing speed are dropped significantly when I use any vanilla QWERTY keyboard, inside and outside Vim. Especially <code>shift</code> is mapped to <code>space</code>, there are just so many vim motion require capital letter or symbols <code>!@#$%^&amp;*(</code> to use. I afraid if one day I have to use some public workstation, I may just stand in front it, type like those who use computer first time.</p>
<p>To change your keyboard layout, either via software( karabiner elements on Mac, xinput on linux ), or via hardware. I haven&rsquo;t touch my Macbook since I have upgrade my keyboard layout on a second hand thinkpad. One of the reason are the keyboard layout on two machine have a huge different after upgrade, since the software used are different on Mac and Linux, I don&rsquo;t want to spend extra day config Macbook just to sync the layout.</p>
<p>Or I can purchase a complible keybord to have the universal layout on different mahcine. Nevertheless, they are expensive and I still need to bring my laptop work outside physical keyboard may not be a good choice.</p>

      <title>Try to find the least key solution to navigate up and down in Vim</title>
      <link>https://sokinpui.github.io/Blog/post/vim11-jk/</link>

      <description>Try to find the least key solution for vertical motion in vanilla Vim</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>TL;DR</strong>, I find my blog is too verbose, let me summarize it.</p>
<p>I am try to find the least key solution to jump within certain numbers of lines, that is
Assume we map J and K to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->j and <!-- raw HTML omitted -->k respectively, for example, <code>nmap J 5J</code>
$$
lines = a \times n \times j/k + b \times j/k
$$</p>
<p>We want the $min(a+b)$ among the $n$ we test.</p>
<p>ALthough I have written this blog to calculate the best remap for J/K, ironcially I find I cannot build muscale memory to use J/K to jumps. I still prefer using 5k, 4k, 10k instead of a fixing number jumps.</p>
<p><strong>This blog is just for fun AH HA.</strong></p>
<hr>
<p>In this blog, I am try to navigate up and down using <code>&lt;c-d&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;c-u&gt;</code>, the remapped <code>J</code> and <code>K</code>, they are remapped to <code>&lt;x&gt;j</code> and <code>&lt;x&gt;k</code> respectively. And jk of course.</p>
<h1 id="why-this-blog">Why this blog?</h1>
<p>I know there is tons of ways I can perform in vertical motion, like plugin <a href="https://github.com/ggandor/leap.nvim">leap.nvim</a>, <a href="https://github.com/folke/flash.nvim">flash.nvim</a>, using <code>/</code> or <code>?</code> to searching, or using fuzzy finder tools like <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim">fzf.vim</a> or <a href="https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim">telescope.nvim</a>. I just want to keep a habit or in another terms, I would like to find a method that can extend my muscle memory to any vanilla vim emluation without too much configuratione.</p>
<h1 id="the-problems">The problems</h1>
<p>I have to move up and down to get my cursor right one some words, sometimes, the words just appear too many times, searching is useless. I don&rsquo;t want to move my hand to get my mouse clicking at that position when I know that I can use just a few keys to get here.</p>
<h1 id="how-i-try-to-solve">How I try to solve</h1>
<ol>
<li>H to the top of the screen</li>
<li>M to middle of the screen</li>
<li>L to the bottom of the screen</li>
<li><code>&lt;c-d&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;c-u&gt;</code></li>
<li>nmap J 5j (4j, 6j, or whatever)</li>
<li>nmap K 5K (4K, 6K, or whatever)</li>
<li>j and k</li>
</ol>
<p>I try to use <code>&lt;c-d&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;c-u&gt;</code> to move half page up and down, they are vim default key bindings. Moreover, they are widely supported by any vim emluation and vanilla vi on random remote server. Use J and K to make a smaller steps, and finally use j and k to move to the lines I want.</p>
<p>But&hellip;, how should J and K mapped? 4j, 6j or 5j? Indeed, I write this blog is to share a short snippets that aims to find the best solution.</p>
<p>The way to navigate is similiar to binary search algorithm, we use the big steps like <code>H</code>, <code>L</code>, <code>M</code>, <code>&lt;c-d&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;c-d&gt;</code> jump to the location around the target. Then we use <code>J</code>, <code>K</code>, <code>j</code> and <code>k</code> to move subtlety.</p>
<p>So, we need to find the less key solution to map J and K in order to get to any lines in screen. The least average jumps needed will be the ideal J and K seeking for.</p>
<p>However, the problems can be simplify to how to use the less key to move within quarter of page. We can mapped H and L to jumps to the upper quarter and lower quarter of the screen, and it is easy.</p>

</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>Set scrolloff=0 to ensure H and L will jump to top and bottom of screen, then we move <!-- raw HTML omitted --> lines down/up, in my case it is 42 // 4 = 10, 10 lines down will jumps quarter of screen.  lastly we set back our scrolloff, in my case, it is 8.</p>
<p>Now, we only need to find the least key to move within quarter of screen.</p>
<p>To find how JK should be mapped, we can find the average number to move from 1 lines to 10 lines with different JK mapped.</p>
<p>here is the snippets I use to find the best JK:</p>

      <title>Efficient vim editing: Don&#39;t use visual mode if possible</title>

      <description>Visual selected and then yank? Why don&amp;#39;t you just yank the text object?</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Efficient tips for you, the beginers vimers.</p>
<h1 id="why">why?</h1>
<p>because it has the same effect, but visual mode have more keys storke</p>
<p>If you often use visual mode before yank or delete text, you should take care, you may be in situation of inefficient editing.</p>
<h1 id="operator-pending-mode-vs-visual-mode">Operator-pending mode vs Visual mode</h1>
<p>Operator-pending mode are mode when vim is waiting your <strong>motion</strong>. What is <strong>motion</strong> in vim? <strong>Motion</strong> means the range of text you would like vim to apply the command. <em>This range</em> can be <code>w</code>, <code>iw</code>, <code>e</code>, or <code>i{</code>. In another words, <strong>motion</strong> means the region of selection. The <strong>motion</strong> I have just mentioned control how the region of text will be applied by the command. Like <code>d</code> in <code>diw</code>.</p>
<p>Visual mode, similiar to drag your mouse selecting random region, for vimers, we usually selected by keyboard, We will be involved to visual mode first, either by <code>v</code>, <code>V</code> or <code>&lt;C-v&gt;</code>, then you move your cursor to select the region you want. Similiar to Operator-pending mode, right? But we take a look how much key you have pressed.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text"><span class="line"><span class="cl">Here is the example text:
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">local M = {
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    local function doSomething(x, y)
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">        local x, y = x, y
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">        return x * y
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">    end
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">}
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>We assume you want to delete the text inside M. If you prefer visual mode.
<img loading="lazy" src="/Blog/post/vim9-efficient-editing/img/visual-mode.gif" type="" alt="./img/visual-mode.gif"  />
the key sequence: <code>vi{x</code></p>
<p>If you prefer Operator-pending mode.
<img loading="lazy" src="/Blog/post/vim9-efficient-editing/img/omode.gif" type="" alt="./img/omode.gif"  />
The key sequence: <code>di{</code></p>
<p>You will save one key by the end. Actually, if you prefer first enter visual-mode, it may be the inertia from using other GUI application with mouse. But remember you don&rsquo;t have to keep such practice in vim, you can directly delete or yank with <strong>motion</strong>. It may be little save in once. However, if you are preparing to use vim for future, you should keep upgrading your editing style smoother. Leverge Operator-pending mode is basic practice for efficient editing.</p>

      <description>Remap keyboard with kmonad</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 id="what-is-kmonad">What is kmonad?</h1>
<p><a href="https://github.com/kmonad/kmonad">kmoand</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>KMonad is an advanced tool that lets you infinitely customize and extend the functionalities of almost any keyboard.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can create layer, remap keyboard keys, make a <a href="https://colemak.com/">colemak</a> on qwerty layout keyboard, create <a href="https://precondition.github.io/home-row-mods">home row modifier</a>, or record keyboard macros.</p>
<p>Since it is a software, you don&rsquo;t have to complie QMK or buy a new keyboard that support recomplied. BTW, I haven&rsquo;t felt laggy when using kmonad, it works both on X11 and Wayland.</p>
<h2 id="install-kmonad">Install kmonad</h2>
<p>The official repo recently support download directly from package manager of Arch Linux, GNU Guix and Void Linux. Non of this is my using distro, so I complied it from source with its <a href="https://github.com/kmonad/kmonad/blob/master/doc/installation.md#using-stack">tutorial</a>.</p>
<p>First we need to clone the repo, then change directory into the cloned repo, finally build it with haskell build tools <strong>stack</strong>, if you haven&rsquo;t install stack, you need to first install it.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span class="line"><span class="cl">git clone https://github.com/kmonad/kmonad.git
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nb">cd</span> kmonad
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">stack install
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Now you can test if it has successfully installed.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span class="line"><span class="cl">kmonad
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Kmonad has a lot of feature you can leverge with, in this blog, I will only introduce features that will be used in tmux. For more details you can check its <a href="https://github.com/kmonad/kmonad/blob/master/keymap/tutorial.kbd">official tutorial</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dhj1eauljwU&amp;t=199s&amp;pp=ygUGa21vbmFk">tutorial on youtube</a></p>

      <title>Strategy to remap Tmux shortcut</title>
      <link>https://sokinpui.github.io/Blog/post/tmux-kmonad/</link>

      <description>Save the sucked tmux default key bindings.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you have use tmux, you know it come with a bad key bindings. Force you to spend time config Tmux. Here are how I use tmux with kmonad to save the sucked default key bindings.</p>
<h1 id="tmux">Tmux</h1>
<p>Since tmux have session, window, and pane. Like navigate windows and pane must be often than session, we will prefer less key to navigate windows and pane than session</p>
<p>Therefore shortcut related to window will in form of <code>M-*</code>(for example alt-a), shortcut related to session will in form of <code>prefix + &lt;keys&gt;</code></p>
<h2 id="change-tmux-prefix">change tmux prefix</h2>
<p>Tmux default prefix suck. <code>Ctrl-b</code> are far from each other, if everytim we run tmux command have to press <code>Ctrl-b</code>, I just suffer. So, I change it to <code>ctrl-space</code> instead.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span class="line"><span class="cl">unbind C-b
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nb">set</span> -g prefix C-space 
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nb">bind</span> C-space send-prefix 
</span></span></code></pre></div><h2 id="session">Session</h2>
<p>Session shortcut will in form of <code>prefix + &lt;keys&gt;</code>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nb">bind</span> n new-session -t
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nb">bind</span> r command-prompt -p <span class="s2">&#34;Enter new session name: &#34;</span> <span class="s2">&#34;rename-session &#39;%%&#39;&#34;</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nb">bind</span> j switch-client -n <span class="c1"># switch to next session</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nb">bind</span> k switch-client - <span class="c1"># switch to previous sessionp</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p><code>prefix+s</code> will show the session list
<img loading="lazy" src="/Blog/post/tmux-kmonad/img/tmux-session-list.png" type="" alt="tmux-session-list"  /></p>
<h2 id="window">Window</h2>
<p>Since windows shortcut are more handy than session&rsquo;s
Bind single key without prefix will be easier for day to day usage</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nb">bind</span> -n M-o new-window <span class="c1"># open new window at home directory $HOME</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nb">bind</span> -n M-enter new-window -c <span class="s2">&#34;#{pane_current_path}&#34;</span> <span class="c1"># open window at the same directory as current pane</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nb">bind</span> -n M-r command-prompt -p <span class="s2">&#34;Enter new window name: &#34;</span> <span class="s2">&#34;rename-window &#39;%%&#39;&#34;</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nb">bind</span> -r -n M-h <span class="k">select</span>-window -t :- <span class="c1"># previous window</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nb">bind</span> -r -n M-l <span class="k">select</span>-window -t :+ <span class="c1"># next window</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">unbind <span class="s1">&#39;&#34;&#39;</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">unbind %
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nb">bind</span> - splitw -v -c <span class="s1">&#39;#{pane_current_path}&#39;</span> <span class="c1"># horizontal split </span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nb">bind</span> <span class="p">|</span> splitw -h -c <span class="s1">&#39;#{pane_current_path}&#39;</span> <span class="c1"># vertical split</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><h2 id="pane">Pane</h2>
<p>Similar to window, but since my main machine is a thinkpad, the screen is so small, I use pane less, if you have a big screen, you may swap some shortcut between window&rsquo;s and pane&rsquo;s</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nb">bind</span> -n M-x kill-pane
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nb">bind</span> -n M-m <span class="k">select</span>-pane -t :.+ <span class="c1"># pane cycling</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nb">bind</span> -n M-f <span class="k">select</span>-pane -t :.+ <span class="c1"># pane cycline </span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nb">bind</span> -r H resize-pane -L <span class="m">5</span>
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nb">bind</span> -r L resize-pane -R <span class="m">5</span> 
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nb">bind</span> -r K resize-pane -U <span class="m">5</span>  
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nb">bind</span> -r J resize-pane -D <span class="m">5</span>
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The first line will kill pane instantly, if there is single pane, kill window instead, if there is single windwo and single pane, kill session instead.</p>
<p>If you wonder how to resolve shortcut conflict with other terminal application require modifier <code>alt</code>, I will try my best to avoid them, leaving all shortcut with <code>alt</code> for tmux, and <code>ctrl</code> for other application. BTW, if you use vim, you will have less chance to use modifier <code>alt</code>, therefore using vi-mode in shell can reduce the relay of <code>alt</code> when line editing.</p>

      <title>Consider Embrance the ecosystem of Neovim.</title>
      <link>https://sokinpui.github.io/Blog/post/vim7-considerneovim/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 04 Aug 2023 22:16:35 +0800</pubDate>

      <description>Blog written for those who are struggling about switch to Neovim from Vim</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Neovim in 2023 has become an popular choice of editor, its version become stable those day. Neovim to Vim is like Vim to Vi those day, it has introduced a clear lua API for writing plugins, built-in LSP support. Although some plugins like <a href="https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim">coc.nvim</a> has provide feature like LSP and auto-completion similar as VSCode, the built-in LSP support just give the sense of it will last longer and improved by a larger community as it is built-in. Also, more lua plugins has come out, which sadly only support Neovim, as they need Neovim API.</p>
<h1 id="vim">Vim</h1>
<p>Back to the day I launch Vim first time, Vim have already give me different feel from modern editor, its default color scheme, its &ldquo;non-beginner friendly&rdquo; default setting force me to google solution many times. After use Vim for sometimes, I have known Neovim, a forked version of Vim, fully compatible with vimscirpt plugins, a modern version of Vim, and extended in different language lua, At the beginning, I don&rsquo;t want to make a switch, current state of Vim was already make me satisfed. The introduction of Vim9script excited me a lot, I wrote vimscirpt before lua, in my opinion, vimscirpt as a Domain Specify Language, it is less verbose than lua. Also, I don&rsquo;t write big plugins, lua API don&rsquo;t attact me much. But the performance of Vim9script has been improved a lot compare to lengency vimscirpt. I still want to stay with Vim. However I discover quite many vimers I have followed on online has switch to Neovim, it is the first time I have consider seriously about making a switch. I can&rsquo;t found myself a good reason not to change other than it may waste my time. Since I use Vim first, the plugins I relay on are still pure vimscirpt plugins, making switching no benefits. I told myself, if there is a must have plugins that is specified to Neovim, I should make a switch.</p>
<h1 id="neovim">Neovim</h1>
<p>The plugin I switch for is <a href="https://github.com/nvim-treesitter/nvim-treesitter">nvim-treesitter</a>. Treesitter provide correct highlight by understanding your code structure. Recently Vim/Neovim highlihgt is base on regular expression, which may not cover all the case, therefore render syntax highlight wrong,</p>
<p>My <code>init.vim</code> without Treesitter:
<img loading="lazy" src="/Blog/post/vim7-considerneovim/no-treesitter.png" type="" alt="no-treesitter"  /></p>
<p>My <code>init.vim</code> with Treesitter:
<img loading="lazy" src="/Blog/post/vim7-considerneovim/treesitter.png" type="" alt="treesitter"  /></p>
<p>Correct highlight is one of feature treesitter can provide, other feature like indention, selection increment/decrement are also supported. If the language you are using have treesitter parse, you can enjoy those features. The abstruct syntax tree where treesitter powered from, is also a good source for writing a plugin, extend you text object to function, class, object, or declaration. Of course regular expression can do so, it just can&rsquo;t make sure 100% correct and need to build rule for matching. I know emacs also integrate Treesitter in Emacs29. I believe plugins that can understand the code will keep exploring more surprise usage, introducting more useful features in the future. Therefor I make switch.</p>
<p>The switching actually don&rsquo;t cost anytime, I spend minutes finding the color scheem support treesitter. Installing them using the plugins manager I used in vim, everything just work.</p>
<h1 id="why-neovim">Why Neovim</h1>
<p>Simply becuase you will have a greater community, both vim and neovim community, merely missing compatible with Vim9script. You can enjoy plugins from Vim and Neovim. This reason is strong enough for one who have struggling between Neovim and Vim. The number of plugins that is written in Vim9script are handfully small.</p>
<h1 id="neovim-from-vim">Neovim from Vim</h1>
<p>Before using Neovim, I use <code>:sh</code> often. However, this command was dropped in Neovim, I don&rsquo;t understand why this is dropped. Nevertheless, I change my habit, even better practice after change. I use new tmux window instead of <code>:sh</code> to recall the shell Neovim from. If I really want to copy some content from the shell opened Neovim, I can use <code>Ctrl-Z</code> to suspend Neovim and use <code>fg</code> continue Neovim process.</p>
<p>I agree some discussion about switching or not, some people hold that there is no features they need in Neovim. That maybe true, but how about plugin ecosystem, it seems more powerful plugins come out, you may want one of them in the future. Switch early so that suffer less in the future. Switch won&rsquo;t consume too much time if you going to keep you configuration in vimscirpt, if necessary to use lua, you can use <code>lua</code> in you <code>*.vim</code> file.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-vim" data-lang="vim"><span class="line"><span class="cl"><span class="nx">lua</span> <span class="nx">require</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s2">&#34;&lt;name of lua moduale&gt;&#34;</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="err">
</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>Switching to Neovim from Vim are simple because you are still using <em>&ldquo;the same&rdquo;</em> editor, the configuration, the way how vim handle text editor, the way to extend is similiar. Unlike switching to other types of editor like Emacs, which definitly have different <em>&ldquo;Emacs way&rdquo;</em> you need to adapt.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You can check the startup time of Vim/Neovim by add the option <code>--startuptime &lt;name of log file&gt;</code>, however meaningful information is difficult to find Maybe you may want to find the plugin that affect startup time most significantly, but lost in tones of numbers and lines. This plugins make testing and viewing startuptime log easier.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you use neither window Nor mac os, you may find you cannot use Ctrl-c to copy and Ctrl-v to paste in terminal. You have to press <code>Ctrl-SHIFT-c</code> to copy selected items, and <code>Ctrl-SHIFT-v</code> to paste from system clipboard.</p>
<p>Window user don&rsquo;t have to concern this issue, because I believe you will endup with wsl, which by the end is close to Linux env. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
Mac user don&rsquo;t need to concern this issue, because you can use <code>CMD-c</code> and <code>CMD-v</code>.</p>

<h1 id="what-does-ctrl-c-do-in-terminal">What does Ctrl-c do in terminal?</h1>
<p>Ctrl + C is used to send a SIGINT signal, which cancels or terminates the currently-running program. The reason Ctrl-c is use to stop program is historic reason. Here is an <a href="https://unix.stackexchange.com/a/245574/566291">answer</a> posted by StackOverflow user <strong>Gilles &lsquo;SO- stop being evil&rsquo;</strong>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The “kill” meaning of Ctrl+C is very old, I think even older than Unix. Wikipedia traces it back to TOPS-10, which would date it from the late 1960s. The article explains why Ctrl+C was a reasonable choice: in ASCII, which was published in 1963, the corresponding character is ETX, end-of-text. Lacking a character meaning “stop”¹, a character meaning “this segment of input is over” was a reasonable choice to mean “stop the current processing”.</p>
<p>The “copy” meaning of Ctrl+C comes from Xerox PARC, the inventors of copy-paste in its modern form (and most other fundamentals of graphical user interfaces). I don&rsquo;t know exactly when that was, but it must have been the late 1970s. This thread on User Experience Stack Exchange discusses the choice of key bindings; C for copy makes a lot of sense.</p>
<p>There was little reason for PARC to reject Ctrl+C for copy on the basis of the existing meaning in TOPS-10 and Unix terminals. Operating systems and applications were more diverse then, and far fewer people used computers; there was no opportunity nor call for a single standard for key bindings across all applications. Other uses for Ctrl+C in popular applications include page-down in WordStar² and mode-specific command in Emacs. All of these were designed independently, for applications with often different requirements, running in different environments.</p>
<p>You can configure the terminal key bindings with the stty command. The terminal bindings are active when the terminal is in cooked mode³. For example the command stty intr ^G sets the character that sends a SIGINT signal to Ctrl+G instead of Ctrl+C. The ^G character is BEL in ASCII; when sent to a terminal, it means “ring the bell”. It&rsquo;s the character that Emacs uses for “interrupt the current operation” (rationale: the application sends BEL to the user via the terminal to interrupt the user; the user sends BEL to the application via the terminal to interrupt the application). It doesn&rsquo;t have a standard meaning when sent to a terminal.</p>
<p>Most shells provide line editing features, so they set the terminal to raw mode. So do full-screen text mode applications. You may need to configure these applications to recognize Ctrl+G instead of Ctrl+C, and some may have non-configurable key bindings. So changing the interrupt character may or may not be practically doable depending on which applications you use.</p>
<p>Another approach could be to configure your terminal to change the byte sequence that it sends for the Ctrl+C keychord, or make it send nothing and instead perform a copy operation. You would also choose a different keychord to send Ctrl+C (if you have a non-laptop PC keyboard, you could use the out-of-the-way Pause/Break key). Not all terminals can be configured in this way.</p>
<p>¹ Ctrl-S (XOFF) means stop, but it&rsquo;s addressed to the terminal, not to the application. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
² Next to Ctrl+X for next-line, with Ctrl+E and Ctrl+R for previous-line and page-up; these keys were chosen due to their placement on a QWERTY keyboard. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
³ Nitpick: cooked mode is a set of terminal settings, including the interpretation of several characters including one that sends an interrupt signal.</p>
</blockquote>
<h1 id="what-does-ctrl-v-do-in">What does Ctrl-v do in</h1>
<p>The CtrlV key often meant &ldquo;verbatim insert&rdquo; – that is, insert the following character literally without performing any associated action.

      <description>Auto pair plugin that work with multi cursor without any issue.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I use multi cursor plugin and auto pairs together, unfortunately I find my old two plugins don&rsquo;t integrate well. <a href="https://github.com/LunarWatcher/auto-pairs">This autopairs from LunarWatcher</a> often throw error: <code>E117: Unknown function: AutoPairsTryInit</code> when end editing with [multi cursor plugin]((<a href="https://github.com/mg979/vim-visual-multi)">https://github.com/mg979/vim-visual-multi)</a>. Although this plugin is already improved to be more compatible with <strong>vim-visual-multi</strong>. To be mentioned, this bug is fixed in this <a href="https://github.com/LunarWatcher/auto-pairs/issues/12#issue-780680284">issue</a>. I still find the bug occur.</p>
<h1 id="another-auto-pair-plugins">Another auto pair plugins</h1>
<p>I google a solution, and finally end up with this Neovim plugins <a href="https://github.com/windwp/nvim-autopairs">nvim-autopairs</a>. Surprisingly, it is feature richer than <a href="https://github.com/LunarWatcher/auto-pairs">this autopairs plugins</a>, unfortunately, it only support Neovim.</p>
<p>Other than basic function, you can extend its auto pairs rule by calling its rule method: (example from its repo)</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Their already have some common rule that provided by its <a href="https://github.com/windwp/nvim-autopairs/wiki/Custom-rules">wiki</a>. One of the very helpful rule is auto addspace on =.</p>

      <description>Markdown setup make text editing become comfortable</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<blockquote>
<p>update at Thu Aug 10 01:10:36 PM CST 2023, add plugin for text object</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>update at Mon Aug 14 01:05:19 PM CST 2023, tex_conceal</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>update at Wed Aug 16 07:33:25 PM CST 2023, Yet another solution to preview markdown file</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mainly Introduce Neovim plugins and share config that help markdown writing.</p>
<p>The Full config is <a href="https://github.com/sokinpui/.dotfiles/tree/main/nvim">here</a></p>
<h1 id="before">Before</h1>
<p>A good markdown setup just make fun easier, though the most weighted thing in writing should be the content instead of the tools you use. But a right tools will make editing a lot easier. Recently markdown can use for note taking, documenting, or blog writing. Markdown is similiar to HTML, but have a clear and readable syntax. Only looking at the syntax, you can already have idea how the file will be reandered. Compare to Tex, the syntax is simpler but less featured, if you don&rsquo;t need complicate layout of your output file, you should consider markdown first. You can use some simple $Latex$ math expression like <code>$\int$</code> in markdown, already well supported by most of markdown editor.</p>
<h1 id="choose-of-editor">Choose of editor</h1>
<p>Oh, accidently involved to editor war, which editor you prefer? BTW, I use Neovim. There is two type editor, one is designed only for markdown, another are designed for general purpose. In my opinion, most of markdown editor, like <strong>Typora</strong>, or note editor but can also use as a markdown editor like <strong>Obsidian</strong> or <strong>logseq</strong>, former provides good reading and editing experience by its <strong>What You see Is What You GET</strong>(WYSIWYG). Latter provides reference link/backlink feature. Both of them are great, nevertheless, as I have mentioned, markdown as a markup language, its syntax is so simple, a good live preview is quite useless. Backlink is useful, but only useful if you take notes, or try to manage your personal knowledge in another new way. I would still prefer a tree organization for my notes, as most of the knowledge I need is well organizated already. Referencing maybe helpful for writer who need brain storming or system like wiki, it is still hard to imagine who have the mental power to manage and navigate a complex inter-referencing system.</p>
<p>Most of the GUI markdown editor in terms of editing has not difference compare to the default &ldquo;Text Edit&rdquo; application of your OS. They may provide some mardkwon syntax allowing you click to insert via mouse, as mentioned above, markdown syntax is so simple that anyone can learn it in one minutes, remember after using a few times. Insert with markdown syntax with mouse is, um &hellip; quite useless, I would say. In terms of editing, I think a general purpose editor may do a better job. Those &ldquo;general purpose editor&rdquo; have another name, code editor, I think any of VSCode, Emacs, Atom or Vim should be better in terms of editing, as they have so many features are for edit text! So pick whatever code editor you like! It is so personal choice, hard to recommend one. Hope this article can provide some idea that also works on yours.</p>
<p>Some features should have for comfortable markdown editing:</p>
<ol>
<li>Jump between files</li>
<li>Searching</li>
<li>File explorer</li>
<li>syntax highlighting
With above items, a comfortable writing environment have done half!</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="setup-with-neovim">Setup with Neovim</h1>
<p>Install those plugins with the manager you prefer. Since those plugins have more than markdown writing, The key mapping and functionality of them are not fully covered here, please check those plugins&rsquo; website to have more details.</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p><code>init</code> will load when vim startup. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<code>config</code> function will load when the plugin is loaded. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
plugins in <code>dependencies</code> are always lazy-loaded unless the main plugins is loaded. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
The benefit os using lazy.nvim is you can lazy load plugins on key, autocmd event, command, filetype. The startup time will be shorter. But most of the time I won&rsquo;t open and close vim oftenly, If I need to run command in shell, I will open a new tmux window, I think it is a good pratice, I would recommend you do so. The reduce of StartupTime is in 10-20 ms in my case compare to using <strong>vim-plug</strong>, really small improvement. But since it is configurate in lua, most of the plugins I recently used provide lua configuration by default, so <strong>lazy.nvim</strong> is convenient a little bit. I don&rsquo;t need to split plugin installation and configuation in two files as used to be in <strong>vim-plug</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="jump-between-files">Jump between files</h2>
<p>I use <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim">fzf.vim</a> to jump between files, I have a notes directory, which is version controlled by git. I can jump files within this directory by fuzzy finding the name of the files. Original <strong>fzf.vim</strong> don&rsquo;t support this feature, it only support find file under current directory by default.</p>

<h2 id="file-explorer">file explorer</h2>
<p>Although fzf is powerful, sometimes I don&rsquo;t remember what is the name of the file. I will use file explorer to navigate to the file I want. I use the plugin <a href="https://github.com/lambdalisue/fern.vim">fern</a>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Fern (furn) is a general purpose asynchronous tree viewer written in pure Vim script.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is very simple by default, some feature can be extended with extension/plugins, like preview file or jump to root directory(directory that contain <code>.git/</code>). It support mosue mapping, you can use mouse to open or expand file/directory as you would expect to do in another GUI editor.</p>

<p>demo:
<img loading="lazy" src="/Blog/post/vim4-markdownwritingsetup/file-explorer-mosue.gif" type="" alt="fern-demo"  /></p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t like the default key bindings, you can change it in <code>~/.config/nvim/ftplugin/fern.vim</code>. For exmaple I have change some of them. Fern have many API you can interact with, You can delete, rename files and directories like other GUI file finder. I don&rsquo;t make move file key bindings, because I regard it is easier to do with my shell.</p>
<p>Preview file when navigate files using jk is helpful when sometimes I don&rsquo;t remember what is the content inside, I can toggle this with <code>p</code> in file explorer buffer. In orde to have this function you hvae to install <a href="https://github.com/yuki-yano/fern-preview.vim">fere plugin for preview</a>.</p>
<p>demo:
<img loading="lazy" src="/Blog/post/vim4-markdownwritingsetup/fern-preview.gif" type="" alt="fern-preview.gif"  /></p>
<p>Another keymapping I use often are <code>R</code>, it will jump to the root of current directory(directory contain <code>.git/</code>), you will need to install <a href="https://github.com/lambdalisue/fern-mapping-project-top.vim">this fern plugin</a>.</p>

<p>Markdown syntax is very simple, even without syntax highlight won&rsquo;t effect writing flow.

<h2 id="header-jumps">header jumps</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/preservim/vim-markdown">vim-markdown</a> provide mapping <code>[[</code> jump to last header above cursor, and <code>]]</code> jump to next header above cursor. Or you prefer a sidebar header TOC, you can use the command <code>Toc</code> to generate a sidebar TOC, you can jump to the header by double click it or press <code>enter</code>.</p>

<h2 id="markdown-preview">Markdown preview</h2>
<p>By me again:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>markdown syntax is so simple that you can preview it in your brain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Mostly the preview is for Math expression, image, video and gif. I will either open browser with <a href="https://github.com/iamcco/markdown-preview.nvim">markown-preivew.nvim</a> or <strong>Obsidian</strong> <del>(Obsidian is the best markdown viewer ever!)</del> to see how my file will be rendered. Obsidian file explorer will show rich content like <code>*.gif</code>, <code>*.png</code> or <code>*.mp4</code>. <del>typora hide them!</del></p>
<p>New plugin found at Wed Aug 16 07:34:40 PM CST 2023, I now totally dropped <strong>markown-preivew.nvim</strong>, and use <a href="https://github.com/sokinpui/open-in-obsidian.nvim">this plugin: open-in-obsidian.nvim</a>. You can open the file using command <code>Obsidian</code> to &ldquo;preview&rdquo; current file in obsidian! why would I need a browser if the file I am editing is already a file inside obsidian vault?</p>

<h2 id="image-clipboard-insertion">Image clipboard insertion</h2>
<p>Paste image from image clipboard to current buffer. Before I know this plugin, whenever I need to paste image, I will open <strong>Obsidian</strong>, because I find their is <a href="https://github.com/reorx/obsidian-paste-image-rename">extension</a> help me. But now I find this plugin, leaving Obsidian merely a markdown reader.

<h2 id="autocompletion">Autocompletion</h2>
<p>The main reason I use an code editor for markdown editing even It don&rsquo;t provide live preview.</p>
<p>Worth to mention again:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>markdown syntax is so simple that you can preview it in your brain.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The cost of drop live preview compare to have autocompletion is nearly zero. With autocompletion, I can be lazy to type, complete the long words occur more than once. Use snippets to insert pre-defined contents. Recently, I have switch from <a href="https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim">coc.nvim</a> to <a href="https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp">nvim-cmp</a> for the plugin <a href="https://github.com/epwalsh/obsidian.nvim">obsidian.nvim</a> to insert reference link. <del>BTW, I find it nearly useles</del></p>

<p>Extend text object in markdown, I found <a href="https://github.com/coachshea/vim-textobj-markdown#code-fences">this plugin: text object for markdown</a>, the code block text object provide by it is extremely useful. It use api from another plugin <a href="https://github.com/kana/vim-textobj-user">vim-textobj-user</a>.

<p>Since using neovim in terminal, some shell hack is required to make writing even more comfortable. I don&rsquo;t use Neovim terminal, its color never display same as my original terminal. Instead, I use tmux new window if I needed. I don&rsquo;t do fancy file management with my Neovim file explorer because I prefer to manage them in shell.</p>
<p>The last required configuration of zsh are merely tab completion and remapping the fully sucked tmux default key bindings.</p>
<p>For zsh completion, I would recommend you read <a href="https://thevaluable.dev/zsh-completion-guide-examples/">this blog detaily cover about zsh completion</a></p>
<p>For tmux configuration guide, I would recommend you read <a href="https://thevaluable.dev/tmux-config-mouseless/">this blog detaily cover about configure tmux</a></p>

<h2 id="conceal">conceal</h2>
<p>Hide the syntax when cursor is not at the line, maybe helpful or not. Vim has this function built-in, you can set <code>set conceallevel=2</code>. vim-markdown also have options that control concealment for different group, they are:</p>
<p><code>let g:vim_markdown_math = 1</code> to enalbe concealment for $Latex$ syntax</p>
<p><code>let g:tex_conceal = &quot;abmgs&quot;</code> to set the concealment options for tex object in both markdown and tex file, see <code>:help tex_conceal</code> to see details of options.</p>
<p><code>let g:vim_markdown_conceal_code_blocks = 1</code> to enalbe concealment for code block delimiter.</p>
<p><code>let g:vim_markdown_strikethrough = 1</code> to enable concealment for Strikethrough. <em>This featuer don&rsquo;t require conceallevel set in vim</em>

<p>Since most of the GUI markdown editor support auto generate list when you hit enter. I found one plugin <a href="https://github.com/dkarter/bullets.vim">bullets.vim</a>. It will auto insert list base on the list symbol last line used. Quite helpful when you insert orderlist. But it seems to break your <code>&lt;CR&gt;</code> in other plugins, but just fine with me, please see <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/neovim/comments/nx4s7g/is_there_an_actually_good_numbered_list_plugin/">this discussion on reddit</a> <!-- raw HTML omitted -->

<p>I will open <strong>Obsidian</strong> and use its search box. Sometimes I will open new tmux windows and search with <a href="https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep">rg(ripgrep)</a></p>
<h1 id="after">After</h1>
<p>As you see, the markdown system built in this blog is totally offline, so that you can choose the tools for different task, like A code editor over in editing, a notes taking app over in reading rich content. I do use some cloud based notes app like notion, However, it often lag, and low in protability, the file is difficult to edit outside it. I am forced to use the function provided by single application. I prefer offline solution than cloud based for markdown writing.</p>

      <description>Simple hack to have XDG based configuration for Vim</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>I have seen some post and issue on Vim github that want XDG base configuration become one of the runtimpath of Vim(not Neovim), actually a simple hack can done so.</p>

</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">ln -s <span class="nv">$HOME</span>/.config/vim <span class="nv">$HOME</span>/.vim
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Do you know there your <code>vimrc</code> can located at either <code>$HOME/.vimrc</code> or <code>$HOME/.vim/vimrc</code>, so you can move your whole runtimpath to <code>$HOME/.config/vim</code>, then create a symbolic link <code>$HOME/.vim</code> point to <code>$HOME/.config/vim</code>.</p>
<p>Although I know XDG is more than just a directory, it may still be helpful for group all your configuration together.</p>

<p><img loading="lazy" src="/Blog/post/vim2-gityourconfig/2023-08-02.png" type="" alt="git"  />
This picture describe what is git, imagine your working direction of your project, when you want to try something new and don&rsquo;t want to break and manually merge new feature to your development, create a branch, like parallel universe, you can take another try in parallel universe, after that, you can merge those branch to your <strong>main</strong> branch or simply delete the branch. <em><strong>&ldquo;Branch is cheap&rdquo;</strong></em>.</p>

<h1 id="usage">Usage</h1>
<p>Neovim community often post some config that is fully configured in lua instead of vimscript, however, you have to make a lot of change, if you want to keep vimscript config separately, try to create a branch call <strong>&ldquo;lua&rdquo;</strong> and you don&rsquo;t have to merge this branch if unnecessary.</p>
<p>I want to try an plugins call <a href="https://github.com/epwalsh/obsidian.nvim">obsidian.nvim</a>, which use <a href="https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp">nvim-cmp</a> as completion frontend, I use <a href="https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim">coc.nvim</a> at that time, so I try to use <strong>nvim-cmp</strong>, you can find more in <a href="../vim-4">this blog</a></p>
<p>If you want to try new plugins without breaking your current config, you can create a branch call <strong>experiment</strong>, before apply change to <strong>main</strong>, test it in <strong>experiment</strong> branch first, later you can merge the change to from <strong>experiment</strong> to <strong>main</strong>. The benefits of this approach is that if you don&rsquo;t want to fix the problem of new plugins now, you can still fallback to your stable, working config, fix the issue when you have free.</p>

      <description>Ha? you want productivity? Vim is useful only when you edit you vim configuration!</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Do you still remember why you choose one editor, because it get the job done? Or its extenability? Or its plugins ecosystem? My first editor is VSCode, introduced by CS50, back to those day, I regard VSCode is the only tools exist on earth that can write code. But I am scared by its UI, there is too much button, too many options. <em>In the future, I find VSCode is defintily one of the easiest get into and out of the box editor.</em> &ldquo;What does plugin means? What is auto pairs? What is completion?&rdquo; I don&rsquo;t understand those terms, I am too young to know manual exist and google for help.</p>
<p>The chance I know Vim is from university Unix talk, it is the first time I know one can navigation using hjkl instead of arrow key. I can&rsquo;t describe how excited I was, since I can&rsquo;t blindtype arrow key, everytime I press arrow I have to look at the keyboard and find them. Although I still use Vim now, I don&rsquo;t feel their is significant productivity increment, since Vim modal editing is avalible many where, I keep using vim simply because changing behaviour of the editor just feel more natural on Vim/Neovim.</p>
<h1 id="the-myth-of-productivity-about-using-vim">The myth of productivity about using Vim</h1>
<p>Many of user claims that full keyboard navigation is more efficient than mouse + keyboard hyper setup. I used to agree so, but the longer time I work with my computer, the more limitation I can feel of being full keyboard navigation. Actually it must be vary from people, one may live in terminal, another one may live in their browser. There is no same definition for productivity, we should not keep using full keyboard navigation as the biggest selling point of Vim. In my understanding, the reason Vim is over other editor only occur if you fully embrance its ecosystem, some Vim command, or some vimsciprt and lua plugin, that is petty but just make your experience different. When you familiar with your editor, you can easily make some change to fullfill you new requirement, this type of productivity is difficult to clone to other tools once you get into one deeply.</p>
<p>Since I use Vim mostly for writing, or note taking. I have install many plugins that can help writing code, yes they do increase my productivity, but only when I use Vim to configure Vim.( It is my personal fault ) Like one of the plugin <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim">fzf.vim</a> is only helpful when I navigate in lua config modual.( Of course it is my case ). However some do significantly increase my productivity. They are auto completion, I can&rsquo;t leave them when writing anymore. By the way, it can done with any modern editor, not Vim stand out here.</p>
<h1 id="the-truth-of-using-vim">The truth of using Vim</h1>
<p>Vim plugin is extremely useful when configure Vim, if I don&rsquo;t config, restructure config, plugin become less useful, but if I don&rsquo;t config Vim, Vim become less useful, If Vim is not useful, Why I still need to use Vim? Vim is actually time-sink, because you can explore so much function with vim. No matter plugins or built-in function, you have so much to tweak. So, why don&rsquo;t take any attribute to use Vim, Vim as toy, make fun with it, don&rsquo;t care about productivity!</p>
<p>Vim modal editing is about muscale memory, you have to put time to practice and try to work with this style of typing. I don&rsquo;t think reading many tutorial will help you learn Vim. Walking  though those long long Vim tutorial will only scare you. Instead, try to read the manual or google for help only when you need them.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, you don&rsquo;t have to build a prefect vim config to work, vanilla vim already quite good only lacking personalized config. Vim distro may obsolute you to use vim for the first time, because you have too many concept need to understand, without the context and background of using Vim, you may find difficult when try to udnerstand terms, or ignore some powerful features, Those Vim distro is more than just editing, they emphasize config and plugins packed together.</p>

      <title>Tips for merging from vim-plug to lazy.nvim</title>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Tips and issue I discovered during mergation. Hope to save someone&rsquo;s time in the future.</p>
<h1 id="why-lazynvim">Why lazy.nvim</h1>
<p>This is a long story, shall we start from another application <a href="https://obsidian.md/">obsidian</a>. I use <strong>obsidian</strong> for notes taking. I want some faster, non-repeative and easier note editing tools, and therefor I use some editor as my obsidian editing engine, in my case, Neovim Setup autocompletion and snippets in Neovim is always easier than same setup on obsidian. In Neovim, we have <a href="https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim">coc.nvim</a>, <a href="https://github.com/hrsh7th/nvim-cmp">nvim-cmp</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ms-jpq/coq_nvim">coq_nvim</a> etc&hellip; And you have many snippets source. However, I cannot easily insert link to files as well as link to header in Vim. Although coc.nvim already provide some <a href="https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim/wiki/Completion-with-sources#completion-sources">source</a>, lacking obsidian. Then I google for solution, I found <a href="https://github.com/epwalsh/obsidian.nvim">obsidian.nvim</a>, which say it provide link completion source for <strong>nvim-cmp</strong>
<img loading="lazy" src="/Blog/post/vim-4/obsidian-nvim.png" type="" alt="obsidian-nvim"  /></p>
<p>Then I have look at nvim-cmp, It separate autocompletion front end and back end, user have too integrate them manually. In terms of personalization, it provide more free. It terms of out-of-box, it is bad. If only insert link to relative file, <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/fzf.vim">fzf.vim</a> with some tweaks can do so.</p>

</span></span></span></code></pre></div><p>But too much tweaks for insert header as smooth as obsidian.</p>
<p>So, I try nvim-cmp, I just find that many of Neovim specify plugins have to configurate in lua, it should be easier to manage those plugin with some Neovim plugin manager like <a href="https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim">lavy.nvim</a>. (Many lua plugins provide snippets for installation and configuration at the same place, but require lazy.nvim or packer.nvim) Then, this is the beginning of this blog.</p>
<h1 id="issue">issue</h1>
<p>can&rsquo;t use pack anymore
require dependency if this is some plugins of plugins.</p>
<p>Lazy.nvim will and need to manage all your plugin, see the description from <strong>lazy.nvim</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>lazy.nvim does NOT use Neovim packages and even disables plugin loading completely (vim.go.loadplugins = false). It takes over the complete startup sequence for more flexibility and better performance.
In practice this means that step 10 of Neovim Initialization is done by Lazy:</p>
<p>All the plugins&rsquo; init() functions are executed
All plugins with lazy=false are loaded. This includes sourcing /plugin and /ftdetect files. (/after will not be sourced yet)
All files from /plugin and /ftdetect directories in you rtp are sourced (excluding /after)
All /after/plugin files are sourced (this includes /after from plugins)</p>
<p>Files from runtime directories are always sourced in alphabetical order.
So all the plugins installed with vim built-in plugins will not be loaded, or you have to add extra options when you calling:</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>when return the plugin table spec to <strong>lazy.nvim</strong>, if you use pack directory to manage personal scirpt or plugins like me, you have to consider move those plugins into your <code>$NVIMRUNTIMPATH</code> <code>~/.confg/nvim</code>. I merge them with simple bash script:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span class="line"><span class="cl">moveToRtp(){

</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">moveToRtp Plugin1 Plugin2 Plugin3 ...
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>This simple script will can move plugins don&rsquo;t contain <code>/after/*</code>. I just merge <code>/after/*</code> manually.</p>
<h1 id="plugins-need-to-take-extra-care-durig-mergation">plugins need to take extra care durig mergation</h1>
<p>Some plugins configuration need special care when configure with <strong>lazy.nvim</strong>. Most of the case I found related to plugins&rsquo; compability with <em>lua</em>, I would recommend if the confiuration is already in vimscript, keep going with vimscript if you don&rsquo;t care performance loss(actually I don&rsquo;t know how much loss, maybe it is ignorable)</p>

</span></span></code></pre></div><p>It should solve most of the problem and save time during mergation because you can avoid rewrite all configuration in lua when vim plugins usually provide vimscript api for configuration.

<p>The <code>tab</code> will sucks if you have setting wrong, this part is the most time-consumming part to debug, I nearly give up with nvim-cmp because of its bad properties.</p>
<p>In <strong>Ultisnips</strong>, you can change the key for expand and jump, since I don&rsquo;t like press <code>&lt;CR&gt;</code> to confirm completion selection, I use <code>&lt;C-j&gt;</code> to expand and jump forward in snips, <code>&lt;C-k&gt;</code> to jump backward.</p>
<p>At the beginning, I try follow plugin table spec for nvim-cmp:</p>

<p>The plugins is more structured, so navigation and group plugins is easier than <strong>vim-plug</strong>, with some <strong>plugin</strong> like <strong>fzf.vim</strong>, I can easily jump to file I want, and separate plugin config into different files according to their purpose. Before using <strong>lazy.nvim</strong> all plugins config are store in the same file call <code>plugins.vim</code>, now modualize like:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-sh" data-lang="sh"><span class="line"><span class="cl">├── config

<p>As most of plugin I used are written for both Vim and Neovim, most of them are still providing vimscript api to config, there are only some little surprise issue from prefect.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Some Vim plugins may save your time. You can use any plugins manager, even the built-in <code>pack</code>.</p>
<h1 id="file-explorer-fernhttpsgithubcomlambdalisuefernvim">File explorer: <a href="https://github.com/lambdalisue/fern.vim">fern</a></h1>
<p>Not too helpful, but I find it is more eye-candy than built-in explorer <code>netrw</code>. Also, <strong>fern</strong> is an asynchronous tree viewer, so it should be smoother than <code>netrw</code> in theory. <strong>fern</strong> allow you change the icon to whatever you like.</p>

<p><strong>Fern</strong> have some plugins extend its functionality, like this <a href="https://github.com/lambdalisue/fern-hijack.vim">fern plugin</a> replace <code>netrw</code> when you open directory using vim. <a href="https://github.com/yuki-yano/fern-preview.vim">preview file in float window</a>. <a href="https://github.com/lambdalisue/fern-hijack.vim">This plugin</a> allow you map key jump to the root of project (by default is ^).

<p><strong>clever-f</strong> extend the Vim&rsquo;s f, F, t and T function, you can press <code>f</code> to jump instead <code>;</code>, similarly, use <code>F</code> to jump backward like <code>,</code>. <strong>clever-f</strong> allow you jump multi lines by default, super convenient when <code>dfn</code> cross line.</p>
<p>Since many symbol ({, (, &ldquo;, and so on) keys are hard to press. <strong>clever-f</strong> by default map f; to match any symbol, super clever!. <em>(I map to <!-- raw HTML omitted -->)</em>

<p><strong>vim-visual-multi</strong> bring this common feature from others editor to Vim. Sometimes it is convenient and more intuitive than <code>:s/pattern/changes/&lt;opt&gt;</code> or visual block mode.</p>
<p>Use a, A, i, O, to insert text like in Vim normal mode. Use x to delete selection. Use r to replace all text in selection like r in Vim visual mode. Press n/N to get next/previous occurrence. Press q to skip current and get next occurrence. Press Q to remove current cursor/selection.</p>
<p>By default, it start multi cursor by pressing <code>&lt;C-n&gt;</code>.(I map it to <code>&lt;leader&gt;n</code>) The most exciting of this plugins is, it has integrated with auto-completion like <a href="https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim">coc.nvim</a>!

      <description>Editor is only useful for editing the configuration file of the editor</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 id="toy-editor">Toy Editor</h1>
<p>Editor, is for editing text, to get the job done, editing code, notes, configuration file. Some editor have the ultimatly extenability or customizability, like neovim, Emacs or vscode. Often we prepare too much to make our editor prefect, making our editor more than just an editor, convert it into something like git client, terminal, even a social recognition. The idea of hackable editor is great, many of us can get benefits from the scriptability to automation or add handy features. However, extenability come with cost. Emacs, the most extenable editor which come with the powerful extention language, Lisp, with Lisp everything related to text is possible to be implemented. You can, however, the biggest pain is you need to know how to, which involve time and practice to know the api and the language itself.</p>
<p><strong>Don&rsquo;t be the one who use their editor only for editing their configuration file.</strong></p>
<h1 id="toy-note-system">Toy note system</h1>
<p>Note system is another time sink, because building a note system is much more complex than build a prefect editor. Note system including editor, viewer, a clipper to collect some snippets, the bridge that integrate all your tools, or a all-in-one workspace. Since building note system is much more interesting than writing, review and organize notes, time is easy go to build a superficially clever system that input and output nothing.</p>
<h1 id="the-truth-of-configuration">The truth of configuration</h1>
<p>Yes, one can build their prefect system that will suit their workflow, if their workflow never change, it is not the truth, right? The best note system should always be the next. Your information system will evolve as you behaviour and workflow change.</p>
<p>Implement the change only when you need it, don&rsquo;t even try to make you system prefect, it won&rsquo;t.</p>

      <description>Do you use tmux? Do you think the default key bndings of tmux unacceptalbe? Here are some tips I have collected.
TIPS 1: Skip prefix After change some key bndings like prefix from C-b to something like C-space, you may still find annoying to press prefix for some handy shortcut like switching windows. To skips the needs of prefix, you may add the option -n before the command To switch windows without prefix using M-n bind -n M-n select-window -t :+ 2: Keyboard Macros Macros are collection of keys sequence, you may find some key on your keyboard is less used like right alt, then you can convert this key as tmux specify modifier key, press this key will do a sequence of shortcut.</description>

<h1 id="tips">TIPS</h1>
<h2 id="1-skip-prefix">1: Skip prefix</h2>
<p>After change some key bndings like prefix from <code>C-b</code> to something like <code>C-space</code>, you may still find annoying to press prefix for some handy shortcut like switching windows.
To skips the needs of prefix, you may add the option <code>-n</code> before the command <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
To switch windows without prefix using <code>M-n</code> <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span class="line"><span class="cl">bind -n M-n select-window -t :+
</span></span></code></pre></div><h2 id="2-keyboard-macros">2: Keyboard Macros</h2>
<p>Macros are collection of keys sequence, you may find some key on your keyboard is less used like <code>right alt</code>, then you can convert this key as tmux specify modifier key, press this key will do a sequence of shortcut. To achieve this, you may need a key mappings application, on Linux I recommand <a href="https://github.com/kmonad/kmonad">kmonad</a>; on Macos, I recommand <a href="https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/">Karabiner elements</a>. If you use karabiner elements, use <a href="https://github.com/yqrashawn/GokuRakuJoudo">goku</a> to configure Karabiner elements JSON file easier, life saver!</p>
<h2 id="3-open-new-window-under-current-directory">3: open new window under current directory</h2>
<p>It is especially great working on small screen laptop, if you spawn new pane, then you are in the same directory, however, if you spawn a new window, you will by default at <code>$HOME</code>. <!-- raw HTML omitted -->
You can use <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span class="line"><span class="cl">bind -n M-o new-window -c &#34;#{pane_current_path}&#34;

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a> is a local note-taking apps, all the files are saved as <code>.md</code> or <code>.pdf</code> format.
<a href="https://www.vim.org/">Vim</a> or <a href="https://neovim.io/">Neovim</a> are great editors that allow you config all days without writing any real code</p>
<p>Obsidian has vim-mode, which support Vim modal editing out of the box. However, due to the font size is not unqiue in obsidian, Like the heading has bigger size, the code block is not at the beginning of the line. Sometimes got confused when using jk to move up and down, you move up may not be where you want to go. Vim modal editing editing works better with mono font, regardly, mono font has less readibility than non-mono font where obsidian used by default. What&rsquo;s more, obsidian vim-mode is not clone of vim, still implement as a vim emulation. You may have <a href="https://github.com/esm7/obsidian-vimrc-support">obsidian vimrc support plugin</a>, so to unlock the power of mapping in obsidian, but you still got a lot limitation. In terms of editing, a real Vim should be better than any vim-emulation, and in terms of notes-taking, any note-taking app should work better than Vim+shell, you don&rsquo;t have notes structure visualization without some extra tweaks.</p>
<h1 id="editing-in-vim">Editing in Vim</h1>
<p>With Vim, you can have those convenience over obsidian:</p>
<ol>
<li>snippets</li>
<li>completion</li>
<li>The best &ldquo;Vim&rdquo; mode</li>
</ol>
<p>The last one should have no doubt. The reason I use snippets and completion in note-taking because I am lazy. Retype the same works again and again are really boring and meangless. Obsidian does have some plugins related to <a href="https://github.com/ArianaKhit/text-snippets-obsidian">snippets</a> and <a href="https://github.com/tadashi-aikawa/obsidian-various-complements-plugin">completion</a>, but setup snippets and completion is just easier and more consisent on Vim. In Vim you can have same UI interface and consisent keyblindings.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
The plugins I use for snippets and completion are <a href="https://github.com/neoclide/coc.nvim">coc.nvim</a> + <a href="https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips">Ultisnips</a> + <a href="https://github.com/neoclide/coc-snippets">coc.snippets</a>, choosing coc.nvim simply because it have provided solution for snippets together with completion out of the box. Of course, there is so much alternatives avalible. The only missing is the backlink completion. But it is fine, insert backlink in obsidian let me have a look of filenames, so that I won&rsquo;t forget the filename and suck typing.</p>
<p>Example configuration for snippets and completion:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span class="line"><span class="cl">Plug &#39;neoclide/coc.nvim&#39;, {&#39;branch&#39;: &#39;release&#39;}

<p>Insert image in markdown with plugins <a href="https://github.com/nicojeske/mousewheel-image-zoom">image resizer</a> and <a href="https://github.com/reorx/obsidian-paste-image-rename">imager inserter</a> is supar convenient, no doubt better than vim.</p>
<h2 id="navigation-in-wrapped-line">Navigation in wrapped line</h2>
<p>Since hard wrapped line will make paragraph look ugly in Obsidian, use soft wrapped line instead, which means one paragraph is actually a long long line. Some mapping will be handy to avoid keep using prefix <code>g</code> again in Vim.</p>

<p>WYSIWYG, what you see is what you get, is one of the highlight of markdown syntax, very simple. To get half experience in Vim, oen can be turn on concealment. <code>set conceallevel=2</code> to convert highlight syntax into unicode character.</p>
<p>Just let better tools takes the jobs. For text editing, take Vim; For notes managment, take Obsidian; For complex data representaion like chart, embedded image and website page, just take any other tools like Notion.</p>

The main benefits of using plugins can avoid use our poor vimscript. Use some great plugin avoid you to rebuild the wheel. Before you are able to write plugin yourself, trust me, any exist plugins is better than yours.</p>
<h1 id="plugins-recommendation">Plugins recommendation</h1>
<h2 id="1-vim-plughttpsgithubcomjunegunnvim-plug">1. <a href="https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug">vim-plug</a></h2>
<p>vim-plug, a plugin manager that help you install, update and <strong>manage</strong> your plugins. Vim come with built-in package manger <code>pack</code>, a subdirectory under <code>.vim/</code>, if don&rsquo;t exist, create it. I usually use build-in <code>pack</code> only for some personal little script, so that I don&rsquo;t have to move forth and back in vim runtime path.</p>
<p>Vim plug syntax is easy, to add random plugins, add those line in your <code>.vimrc</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span class="line"><span class="cl">call plug#begin()
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">&#34; list plugins herer
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">Plug &#39;junegunn/vim-easy-align&#39;
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">call plug#end()
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>Any github repo can be installed, for example, you have write your <em>plugin</em> and push to github at <a href="https://github.com/username/plugin-name">https://github.com/username/plugin-name</a>, you can add this <em>plugin</em> by adding those line in your <code>.vimrc</code>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span class="line"><span class="cl">call plug#begin()
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">&#34; list plugins herer
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">Plug &#39;username/plugin-name&#39;
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">call plug#end()
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>After that, save your file by <code>:w</code>, source your <code>.vimrc</code> or leave then reopen your <code>.vimrc</code>, run the command <code>:PlugInstall</code>. Plugins will be installed at <code>~/.vim/plugged</code> by default.</p>
<p>To save my little pinky finger, I have those mapping for convenience:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span class="line"><span class="cl">nnoremap \i :w&lt;cr&gt;:source ~/.vim/vimrc&lt;cr&gt;:PlugInstall&lt;cr&gt;
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">nnoremap \c :w&lt;cr&gt;:source ~/.vim/vimrc&lt;cr&gt;:PlugClean&lt;cr&gt;
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">nnoremap \u :w&lt;cr&gt;:source ~/.vim/vimrc&lt;cr&gt;:PlugUpdate&lt;cr&gt;
</span></span></code></pre></div><h2 id="2-vim-sandwichhttpsgithubcommachakannvim-sandwich">2. <a href="https://github.com/machakann/vim-sandwich">vim-sandwich</a></h2>
<p>vim-sandwich help you to change the surround of text. What is surround? Surround means the pairs that surround text object, like <code>&quot;</code> and <code>(</code>. It is handy to let program do for us, instead of change manually.</p>
<p><a href="https://github.com/machakann/vim-sandwich">vim-sandwich</a> is an alternative of <a href="https://github.com/tpope/vim-surround">vim-surround</a>, which provide texthighligh, auto-selection, and repeat with <code>.</code> out-of the box. It use less keys than vim-surround, just navigate to the current parenthesis object position and chagne the surround! No need to select the object before change.
surround style of changing surround:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span class="line"><span class="cl">cs &lt;surround to be changed&gt; &lt;surround to replace&gt;
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>sandwich style of changing surround(auto replace):</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span class="line"><span class="cl">srb &lt;surround to be changed&gt; &lt;surround to replace&gt;
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>I though it is a more intutitive than to surround style of change, as symbol like <code>{</code>, <code>[</code> and <code>(</code> is more difficult to type than navigate to the right position with <code>f</code>, <code>t</code>, <code>F</code> and <code>T</code>.</p>
<p>The auto-selection of vim-sandwich is highlight of this plugin, I have use this feaatur for all surround editing including add, delete and replace surrounds. I have the following setting so that I can use <code>&lt;leader&gt;+symbols</code> to add surround for one words or selected region</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rhysd/clever-f.vim">clever-f</a> is a plugin that improve the smoothness and consisent when navigation with <code>f</code>, <code>t</code>, <code>F</code> and <code>T</code>. You can use <code>f</code> to navigate to next <code>f</code> search, or use <code>F</code> to navigate backwards, instead of using <code>;</code> and <code>,</code>. What&rsquo;s more, you can remap <code>;</code> and <code>,</code> for other purpose. When you press <code>f</code> to navigate <code>f</code> search, you can cross the line, and you can have smart case searching!</p>
<p>After using this plugin, I won&rsquo;t claim it is more efficient than <code>;</code> and <code>,</code>, but it must be more comfortable.</p>
<p>You can change the behaviour of the plugins by adding those line to your <code>.vimrc</code>.</p>

<p>coc.nvim is a plugins framework, so you may find coc-XXX plugin written in Javascript or Typescript. Some of them is unique, some of them is alternative to the existing vim plugins to compatilbe with coc.nvim. One is <a href="https://github.com/neoclide/coc-snippets">coc.snippets</a>, which aims to replace <a href="https://github.com/SirVer/ultisnips">Ultisnips</a> when you use coc.nvim. coc.nvim use is written Javascript and Typescript, you will configure the popup window in JSON file.</p>
<p>By default, coc.nvim don&rsquo;t come with any keyblindings, you have to configure yourself.</p>
<p>For example, you can:</p>

Emacs Evil mode, a Vi layer on top of Emacs, in my understanding, Evil is a collection of keys remapping that blinds Emacs function to vi style keys. I love elisp, its powerful expression, the robust ecosystem built on top of elisp, tones of API that help writing my own plugins. I thought it is the most apporach Vim emluation I have tried, if Emacs is start as emacs -nw, it will successly pretend Vim TUI!</description>

<p><a href="https://github.com/vscode-neovim/vscode-neovim">Vscode-Neovim</a>, it uses a fully embedded Neovim instance, so Vscode-Neovim can read the <code>init.vim</code> and <code>init.lua</code>. Which is really cool, don&rsquo;t have to google the API before configuraion.</p>
<p>However, I feel the gap when using them. They are great emluation of Vim modal editing, however, other than editing, some important values are still not able to copy, like the integration with shell, and relay on third parity plugin on their ecosystem. Moreoever, I don&rsquo;t feel over advantage to use an emluation than native Vim.</p>
<h1 id="emluation-cant">Emluation can&rsquo;t</h1>
<p><code>Q</code> to enter ex mode in Evil.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<code>q:</code>, <code>q?</code>, <code>q/</code>in Vscode-Neovim(extremely useful!)
<code>sh</code> in both.(sometimes I want to copy the previous command output)
<code>term</code> in Vscode-Neovim to popup an termianl
<code>:help</code> in Evil.</p>

<p>(edited at Mon Jun 26 12:49:55 PM CST 2023)</p>
<h1 id="gravity">Gravity</h1>
<p>Merge to new editor is harder than I thought, I have tried Vscode and Emacs, while they are great editor, but just required sometimes to copy the workflow from my old editor to new editor. Even copied all the keyblindings, some minor but unacceptable difference keep consumming my time to google a solution. For example, the Tab completion style difference between Vscode, Emacs and Vim, I like the popup window of Vim, the tab YouCompleteMe style tab cycling, to get the same setup on Emacs and Vscode are terrible.</p>
<p>Also, the greatest gravity fallback to the original editor is no productivity gain from switching. If finally I endup with the same writing and editing experience on other editors, I still reach the same level of speed and productivity, then so what? The core of those editor hasn&rsquo;t changed, editing text, maybe Emacs can extand more than editing text.</p>
<p>After giving a try to those editors, I finally satisify with my current editor. Just be reason when switching tools that have the same functionality in terms of your workflows, especially there is no issue with the current one.</p>

      <description>From Mac to Thinkpad 2020 Macbook Air with M1 chips, my first computer used in univserity. There is three reasons I brought it, light weight, no fans and long battery life. But surprisingly, I discover that they are no gaming changer when I get into univserity.
There is charger everywhere in univserity library, I don&amp;rsquo;t often move my computer, and I don&amp;rsquo;t have heavier work on my computer.
Switching is not correct in my situation, I don&amp;rsquo;t sold my Macbook, instead I brough a second hand Thinkpad x1 carbon 6th 2019.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 id="from-mac-to-thinkpad">From Mac to Thinkpad</h1>
<p>2020 Macbook Air with M1 chips, my first computer used in univserity. There is three reasons I brought it, light weight, no fans and long battery life. But surprisingly, I discover that they are no gaming changer when I get into univserity.</p>
<p>There is charger everywhere in univserity library, I don&rsquo;t often move my computer, and I don&rsquo;t have heavier work on my computer.</p>
<p>Switching is not correct in my situation, I don&rsquo;t sold my Macbook, instead I brough a second hand Thinkpad x1 carbon 6th 2019. Nevertheless, I haven&rsquo;t used my Macbook three month ago.</p>
<p>The reason I starting using thinkpad is so silly. After using Macbook for 9 months at univserity, I start to play with my keyboard, try different keyboard layout, also designed my own keyboard layout, I use <a href="https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/">Karabiner-Elements</a> and <a href="https://github.com/yqrashawn/GokuRakuJoudo">Goku</a> to config Karabiner Elements JSON file. Still there are some limitations on mac when remapping keys. Then, I discovered <a href="https://github.com/kmonad/kmonad">kmonad</a>, which seems to be more powerful, more free, and more structured syntax when compare to terrible JSON indention. Sadly, I found kmonad do not work on my Macbook, and it seems to work better on Linux(I still don&rsquo;t know the answer until now)?</p>
<p>After the x1 carbon reached, I install Linux distribution and then kmonad immediately, Kmonad work perfect on linux! <strong>The silly fact is I have stopped tweaking my keyboard layout, I drop all the complex layer after using kmoand for a whole</strong>.</p>
<h1 id="switching-gap">Switching gap</h1>
<p>No gap exist when switching, because I sedomly use Mac specified application, most of my favourite applications are cross platform, or have web version. Some application like mail and pdf editor are quite different on Linux and Macos, nevertheless, there is full documeted guide availible on univserity website. They are not an issue. Moreoever, most of the time I found myself living in browser, there will not be any significant difference in sense of user experience between Linux and Macos, instead of switching From Chrome to firefox. <strong>Google Chrome look like second class on linux, while Firefox have gesture supporting and smooth scrolling out of the box</strong>, Google Chrome haven&rsquo;t come with gesture on my Linux distribution. But still, they are all fine.</p>
<h1 id="habbits-change-after-on-thinkpad">Habbits Change after on Thinkpad</h1>
<p>Switching has helped me discovering and changein my daily computer using habbits and my philosophy of desktop environment.</p>
<h2 id="from-messay-virtual-desktop-to-organized-workspace">From messay virtual desktop to organized workspace</h2>
<p>I had one bad habbit on Macos, I give every application a single virtual desktop, making switching application difficult. Suffering from sliding between virtual desktop or type the names of applications on spotlight search. Because of the implmentaton difference on GNOME and Macos, the workspace(equivalent to Macos virtual desktop) icon is so small, forcing me not to give one workspace per application. Since often I can&rsquo;t memorize where are the applications, and it is difficult to look for the application on the tiny workspace icon. Nevertheless, I finally found the right usage of workspace, group related windows in the same workspace. I cannot count how much energy have been waste on finding the right location of the wanted applications.</p>
<h2 id="from-tilling-windows-fans-to-floating-windows-fans">From tilling windows fans to floating windows fans</h2>
<p>Before doing meaningful stuff on computer, we first make ourself look cool, where 99% of time tweaking the desktop environment, remaining 1% doing real stuff.Tilling windows look cool, like hacker sitting in front of multiple screens. I use <a href="https://github.com/koekeishiya/yabai">yabai</a> on mac, before I try linux I have seen a lot of tilling windows manager screenshots sharing. They are really cool. But, most of the tilling windows manager are keyboard oriented, while the keyboard size of laptop are usually small, which mean I have to press keys with modifiers together, at the beginning, I am fine, but after a while, my little pinky finger suffer. I have rarely at the situation that have to switch between windows, of course no need for dynamic management of windows. I find floating windows is a more intuitive way to manage windows, and pinky-friendly.</p>
<h2 id="from-40-keyboard-fans-to-87-to-100-to-200">From 40% keyboard fans to 87% to 100% to 200%?</h2>
<p>40% keyboard look cool, it hold you hand in four main rows, so it is more efficient. Um&hellip;, that how I used to be thought about 40% keyboard, while saving thousand of miles finger move, I have to press every special symbols and numbers by modifiers, hold many key together, untypable if I move to new keyboard or new laptop. Currently I don&rsquo;t get the philosophy of low profile keyboard, instead I prefer double keyboard now. Literaly high profile keyboard, 180% keyboard. Those extra keys are used as marcos. I saved those handy shortcut combination into single keys, like I have map &ldquo;7&rdquo; on numpad as &ldquo;C-c C-t C-v enter&rdquo;, &ldquo;4&rdquo; on numpad as my univserity mail address. I am so naive that I have implmented a 40% keyboard on Macbook keyboard, leaving the number rows unused HAHA.

Time spending on notes taking app Effie When I have to take notes, I fisrt using Effie, but then I find it don&amp;rsquo;t have good image insert support, give up. Their idea is great, notes or writing apps should be clean enough and later I find every notes app say they are clean.</description>

tool with the less efficient one. It takes me so long to understand those apps
doesn&rsquo;t matter if just want to take a notes</p>
<h1 id="time-spending-on-notes-taking-app">Time spending on notes taking app</h1>
<h2 id="effie">Effie</h2>
<p>When I have to take notes, I fisrt using <a href="https://www.effie.pro/">Effie</a>, but
then I find it don&rsquo;t have good image insert support, give up. Their idea is
great, notes or writing apps should be clean enough and later I find every notes
app say they are clean.</p>
<h2 id="notion">Notion</h2>
<p>The next app is <a href="https://www.notion.so/desktop">notion</a>, it is great, the
markdown blocks and integration of app make notion eye-cream, but then regarding
the loading time take decade long, no offline support, and most of my time are
dragging blocks make my workspace more pretty.  &ldquo;Um&hellip; A good notes should look
like this.&rdquo;, regarding my terrible sense of beauty, the &ldquo;design&rdquo; never fit my
imagination of prefect notes. Notion maybe too capable for a note taking app,
the database function make them customizable, I want writing notes, but not
build website. Nevertheelss, Notion now becoming my todo list, and event
recorder, how great it support syncing across all devices, and can be access
with browser.</p>
<h2 id="onenote-collanote-goodnotes-remarkable">OneNote, CollaNote, Goodnotes, Remarkable</h2>
<p>All of them used to be kept my handwriting notes, among them, OneNotes is canva,
CollaNote is vertical scrolling canva, Goodnotes is a good handwriting notes app
but neet to pay. Remarkable is an accidient, I never understand why I think it
can take a notes with high writing delay and slow responding time. All of them
have been used on 2018 Ipad with 20.7 grams Apple Pencil (1st Generation).  This
gen pencil is too heavy, compare to Samsung 8 grams S Pen, it is like holding a
sticker stamp on glass. I remember I have spend so much time finding free
alternative on Ipad since good software and hardware are expensive, and finally
stay with second hand Samsung tab S7.</p>
<h2 id="obsidian">Obsidian</h2>
<p>Before trying Obsidian, I have finally realize that note is simple as markdown,
no need of those notion blocks or Effie cards. basiclly supporting tree
directories selection and image insertion is a must. Obsidian do quite well, and
finally I realize how much time is wasted on making my own notion note space. No
database and todo list is needed, and therefore Obsidian is enough to write and
manager notes.</p>
<p>When tinkering a customizalbe tools, I always try to make the tools part of
mine, try to complish all the tasks with the lovest tools. When there exist a
better tools, still I have to use my lovely tools try to accomplish the task, if
not, then google way to implement it. Most of the time tinkering the tools,
losting the initial goal, turn into making my tools super powerful and
multi-funcional. Therefore, never love your tools, getting the job done in
efficient way is much more elegant than done the jobs with the specify tools, if
the initial goal is getting the task done.</p>
<h1 id="editor">Editor</h1>
<p>Editor is another time sink source. Vim is the first editor I know it is a
editor, I have use vscode before but I don&rsquo;t know it is a editor, back to the
day using vscode, I am scaring of those UI, I don&rsquo;t know what will happen if I
turn on/off some of thems. Vim is clean, simple and elegant. However, it is like
a mindset trap, the more I know Vim, the stronger will to do all in vim way. Vim
bring me to shell, shell bring me to plain text operation. A mindset form,
command line and plain text are efficient, GUI and mouse are evil. At that time,
I have read many article of how to navigate laptop with only keyboard and vim
like motion. Most of the time spend on google &ldquo;how to do XXX in vim&rdquo; and &ldquo;how to
do XXX in cli&rdquo;. Still worse, I have imaged many situation that never happen,
prepare a function or shortcut to overcome the problem never happen in future.</p>
<p>Any customizalbe editor can be time sink to configure, they becoming toies
insteat of tools, I am adding too much unnecessary function before applied in
real context. All those function and shortcut should only solved and implment in
fly or they are repetitive to give a handy marco. When some special case rise, I
am aware if it can be handle in &ldquo;simpler&rdquo; way, the real is they seldom occur in
the future. However, time is wasted already.</p>
<h1 id="problems-of-upgrading-productivity-through-changing-tools">Problems of upgrading productivity through changing tools.</h1>
<p>Replacing the current tools with a more productivity one is often handy and
attactive, imaging better functionalility of newer tools and get the job more
efficient and elegant. However most of the time is spent on move data and
rebuild working flow. When I merge my notes from Effie to notion, it take me one
day to do so, it is repeative and boring to copy all the structure of the notes.<br>
My current strategy are of merging notes are don&rsquo;t touch the notes unless
necessary, most of my old notes are still keeping on notion instead merging them
into obsidian, although it may feel statisfy too see a deep direcotry of notes
on Obsidian side bar. It just too time consumming, no real benefit to merge all
the notes into single place, whatever the notes still appear in both apps, it is
really not difference to merge from one to one and separate them.</p>
<h2 id="changing-tools">Changing tools</h2>
<p>I always want to try new tools, like emacs, vscode, Obsidian open source
alternative, Mac built-in preview.app &ldquo;better alternative&rdquo;. Try them like
playing new toy, fun but no real gain. I try them under the name of learning,
and end up with tinkering configure.</p>

      <description>Abstraction Provide a way to dynamic swap numbers and symbols in vim according to current mode.
How this idea come When I write code or writing, I often find the symbols should be easily type as single key stroke, while in vim normal mode I find I would like to press number in single mode instead of pressing with shift. At first, I searched online for solution, many of them suggested to swap numbers and symbols, and I agree it may convient while coding.</description>
      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 id="abstraction">Abstraction</h1>
<p>Provide a way to dynamic swap numbers and symbols in vim according to current
mode.</p>
<h1 id="how-this-idea-come">How this idea come</h1>
<p>When I write code or writing, I often find the symbols should be easily type as
single key stroke, while in vim normal mode I find I would like to press number
in single mode instead of pressing with <code>shift</code>. At first, I searched online for
solution, many of them suggested to swap numbers and symbols, and I agree it may
convient while coding. However, I am not coding all day, even during coding, in
vim normal mode something it is handy to use number for <code>[count]</code> and command
together. So swapping force you to choose one of them for more convenience
typing. Another solution is to use number pad layer, I would say it is same as
swapping, since I have to press with another key to use numbers, the problem
havn&rsquo;t been solved.</p>
<p>One day, When I was editing code, the idea of toggling nubmer-symbol row come in
my mind, then I implement it, and find it solve the problem quite well regarding
not prefect.</p>
<h1 id="number-symbols-toggle">Number-symbols toggle</h1>
<p>Well, it is actually a dead key leader, when I press the <code>toggle key</code> which is
<code>equal sign</code> of my keyboard. The nubmer row will swap to symbol row, press
again, back to number.</p>
<h1 id="dynamic-number-symbols-row-in-vim">Dynamic Number-symbols row in vim</h1>
<p>Since vim is modual, when insert mode, I prefer using symbols over numbers, when
normal mode, I prefer the opposite. Then I add some rules for the toggle keys.</p>
<p>Back to normal mode, which is equivalent to press the <code>esc</code> key, so when press
<code>esc</code> key, define <code>nst</code> to False. It means toggle number rows.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span class="line"><span class="cl">[:escape :left_control nil {:alone [ [&#34;nst&#34; 0] [&#34;n-layer&#34; 0] :escape  ]} ]
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The above snippets is goku code, a config layer on top of <a href="https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/">Download
Karabiner Elements</a>, which is a tools for
Mac to remap keyboard layouts.</p>
<p>Enter insert mode, is equivalent to <code>a</code>, <code>i</code>, <code>s</code>, <code>A</code>, <code>I</code>, <code>S</code>, <code>o</code>, <code>O</code>, <code>c</code>,
<code>C</code>. Then turn <code>nst</code> to True when type those key.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span class="line"><span class="cl">[:i                           [:i  [&#34;nst&#34; 1]]]   
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">[:a                           [:a  [&#34;nst&#34; 1]]]   
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">[:s                           [:s  [&#34;nst&#34; 1]]]   
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">[:c                           [:c  [&#34;nst&#34; 1]]]   
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">[:o                           [:o  [&#34;nst&#34; 1]]]   
</span></span></code></pre></div><p>The above code define <code>nst</code> to True when type <code>i</code> ( not <code>I</code> ).</p>
<p>Furthur more, there is a few more situation I would prefer symbols over number,
they are searching and command mode. Then I add those lines also.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" class="chroma"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span class="line"><span class="cl">[:semicolon                   [:semicolon [&#34;nst&#34; 1]]]   
</span></span><span class="line"><span class="cl">[:slash                       [:slash [&#34;nst&#34; 1]] ]
</span></span></code></pre></div><h1 id="inprefect">Inprefect</h1>
<p>Since the layer is define outside vim, it can not avoid symbols row toggle
during normal mode, when I type <code>yip</code> in normal mode, the symbol row toggle.
Although I can have some line like <code>inoremap 1 !</code> and <code>cnoremap 2 @</code>, I don&rsquo;t
want to pollute my mapping to much, I give up to implement this in pure vim way.
I am interesting to find how to let karabiner know that I am in vim normal mode,
so that avoid toggle symbol row accidently.</p>
<p>I have remap <code>equal sign</code> to the <code>caps lock</code>, so it is possible for me to have
one dead key, if you want to implement also, you may find your own.</p>

<h1 id="define-your-customized-layer">Define your customized layer</h1>
<h2 id="1-why-define-layer">1. Why define layer</h2>
<p>The functionality of keyboard can be exteneded, one way is to define your own
layers. With layers, you can shorten the key blindings in some &ldquo;shortcut&rdquo;
usually require pressing three to four keys together. Or build an symbols layer
if you stuck in the current <code>number + shift</code> way.</p>
<h2 id="2-different-types-of-layers">2. Different types of layers</h2>
<h3 id="traditional-layers">Traditional layers</h3>
<p>Traditional layers like the layers of QMK mod-tap feature, a key&rsquo;s function is
divide into two, when you held down, it is modifier, and you loss its tap&rsquo;s
function, and vice verse.</p>
<h3 id="simlayers">Simlayers</h3>
<p>In Goku, <strong>simlayer</strong>(simultianeous-layer) differ from traditional layers which
you would not loss key&rsquo;s original fucniton. <strong>For example, if you define <code>f</code> as
your simlayer, if you held down <code>f</code>, stream of <code>f</code> will be inserted. Conversely,
if you define <code>f</code> as tranditional layers, no <code>f</code> is insertd even you held it
down.</strong></p>
<p>In the
<a href="https://github.com/yqrashawn/GokuRakuJoudo/blob/master/tutorial.md">tutorial</a>
of goku, author states the problems of traditional layers. But to me, they are
the benefits, since simalayer have delayed display and require really fast right
key followed. So, in this page, I would suggest you to use traditional layers.</p>

use <code>right shift</code> to escape.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
The single tap check is a little bit complicate, nil is introduced in mod-tap
layer which extended the <code>to event</code>, new <code>:delayed</code> control the behaviour after
the key tapped, <code>:invoked</code> and <code>:canceled</code> work as their name.  <code>:params {:delay  1000}</code> denote the time for the accepted delay time, <code>invoked</code> event trigger
before that time, <code>canceled</code> event trigger after that time.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<strong>The double tap check should be put before single tap check.</strong><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
To escape the layer use the same key use the follow snippet instead:</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h1 id="abstruct">Abstruct</h1>
<p>2023 is a start of AI era, with more strong AI tools explore to our life, typing
maybe replaced by voice input one day, where natural language programming become
true. But until now, typing is still not replacable. From daily usage to
programming, the location of the keys may significantly effect the comfortable
of long time typing. Here is a brief solution that hope to enhance the
experience when typing on standard 78% keyboard.</p>
<h1 id="reason-to-redesign">Reason to redesign.</h1>
<p>I use Macbook Air as my main machine, stick to it and cannot use an customizable
keyboard like <strong>planck&rsquo;s keyboard</strong> and <strong>hhkb keyboard</strong> for the desire of
protable. The plain of using standard 78% keyboard on Macbook is the overusage
of pinky, <code>Backspace</code>, <code>[</code>, <code>]</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>=</code> and <code>Enter</code> are all handled by right
pinky. As my right pinky is much weaker than left, which make typing long time a
difficult, inefficient and tired task. I believe it is true for other user who
programming a lot with Macbook.</p>
<p>There are so many plans and existing well designed layouts on the Internet,
while they are mainly for one who use a external non-standard keyboards instead
of standard. So I hope there will be more disscusion about configuration of
trivail standard keyboard.</p>
<h1 id="choose-of-base-layer-qwerty">Choose of base layer, Qwerty</h1>
<p>Not Colemak, Dvoark and any non-Qwerty. I have tried Colemak and Dvoark, but the
musale memory of Qwerty is too strong that make me feel more natural and
comfortalbe typing on Qwerty. Moreover, the change of layout may not bring
significant advantages and comfor for typing, 10 keys on homerow is never
enough, whatever layouts, your fingers still need to move along three rows to
type characters. The analysis of those Qwerty alternative always be to ideal,
without mention of muscale memory and symbols make such change not really solve
the plain. Another reason is that the time cost is too high and the improvement
is not that big, there is not need to explain why the time cost is high as it is
well explained by those Qwetrty touch typer how share their experience of
switching to non-Qwerty.</p>
<h1 id="analysis-before-design">Analysis before design</h1>
<p>Except the function row, all row is easier to reach even for number rows. I
don&rsquo;t touch type numbers rows using pinky fingers. Instead, I use ring fingers
which are much longers then pinky fingers. So the keyboard layout don&rsquo;t need to
relay on layers heavily like 40% planck&rsquo;s keyboard.</p>
<p>Let counts the key we need:</p>
<ol>
<li>30 characters on the main area of the keyboard including <code>,</code>, <code>.</code>, <code>/</code> and
<code>;</code>.</li>
<li>13 keys on numbers</li>
<li>8 modifier keys, <code>capslock</code>, <code>left right option</code>, <code>left right command</code>, <code>left  shift</code>, <code>control</code>, <code>fn</code> I don&rsquo;t count right shift since I never use it.</li>
<li>4 special keys, including <code>space</code>, <code>reutrn</code>, <code>tab</code> and <code>delete</code>.</li>
<li>4 arrow keys, I don&rsquo;t want to use home row arrow keys, since I seldom use
them, there is no need to prepare a layer for them.</li>
</ol>
<p>61 keys is already sweat enough for daily used, for those shortcut, I usually
reduce them from three or above keys into two keys by define a customizing
layer.</p>
<h1 id="layers">Layers</h1>
<p>There are two types of layers, dead keys and modifers</p>
<h2 id="dead-keys">Dead keys</h2>
<p>The layout of keyboard is chagned permanently untill you press other keys or the
inactive keys. One of the exmaple are the comma of
<a href="https://github.com/workman-layout/Workman/tree/master/mac">workman-dead</a>.</p>
<h2 id="modifers">modifers</h2>
<p>The layout is changed temporary, the layout return to default after release. One
of the example is <code>shift</code>.</p>
<h2 id="my-solution">My solution</h2>
<p>There are some keys that is underused, like space, tab and return. There are
much space that can be leveraged. They should perform tap-mode, which provide
two funciton when tap and held them down.</p>
<ol>
<li>Remap <code>space</code> to <code>space</code> when tap, <code>shift</code> when held.
It is much comfortable compare to use pinky finger to press shift.</li>
<li>Remap <code>left shift</code> to <code>escape</code> when tap, <code>control</code> when held. I use vim.</li>
<li>swap numbers and symbols for programming.</li>
<li>remap <code>caps lock</code> to <code>=</code> when tap, switch layer when held.</li>
<li>swap quote <code>'</code> and double quote <code>'</code>, and locate at the original position of
open bracket.</li>
<li>move hyphen and underscore to the original position of quote.</li>
<li>move backslash and pipe to the original position of hyphen.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Layers:</strong><!-- raw HTML omitted -->
caps lock layers(held down caps lock):<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
u: ]<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
i: [<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
j: }<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
k: {<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h2 id="macro-sequences">Macro sequences</h2>
<p>You can define a simple key that perform a sequence of key. It is better put
them in a layer to avoid error when typing.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
I have defined some in the caps lock layer.<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
d: -&gt;<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
f: !=<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
:: @:<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
<h1 id="implementation">Implementation</h1>
<p>You may wonder how to implement those change on Mac, you may use <a href="https://karabiner-elements.pqrs.org/">Karabiner
Elements</a> together with
<a href="https://github.com/yqrashawn/GokuRakuJoudo">Goku</a> to define your own keyboard
layout.</p>
<h1 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h1>
<p>There are lots of method to increase comfortable and efficiency to get the job
done, before typing to modify your keyboard, make sure you have tried to use
<strong>good tools</strong> like Vim, IDE, auto compeletion, snippets and scritping to
reduece typing. Single modification of keyboard won&rsquo;t make you a better typer.<br>
With the help of snippets and auto completion, I now write code with less demand
to type all the symbols manually, therefor a entire symbols layers on homerow is
no needed(Previously I have one, use space to active, convert home row into
common used symbols.)</p>
